# Slider


A slider allows users to select a value or position from a range.

## How to Use

- Use a slider when your user needs to manually adjust the progress or volume.

- The leftmost of the slider indicates the minimum value, and the rightmost indicates the maximum value.

- Users can view or select a value (or a value range) in a range along the bar.

- The slider should respond to user operations immediately.

- To avoid poor user experience caused by delay, do not use the slider for setting adjustment.
