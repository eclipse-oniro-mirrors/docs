##  Animation Overview

OpenHarmony uses growth-inspired animation designs with the purpose of creating a natural, intuitive, seamless user experience. These animations provide clear feedback and visual guidance in addition to rich visual experience. "Growth" is the process and law that all things must go through in nature. Through growth, all things change continuously and show diverse forms. We have managed to extract the features of growth and apply them to animation design.


## Use Scenarios

Use animations to show how things change. An animation is a straightforward way to communicate with users. It tells users what will happen when an action is performed and what they can do next.


## How to Use

- Use animations only when necessary. Gratuitous animations are distracting.

- Follow the physical law in their implementation.

- Make animations fast, concise, and accurate. Ensure that they meet the definition of younger and lightweight.
