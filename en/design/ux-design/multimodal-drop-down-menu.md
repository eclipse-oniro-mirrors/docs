## How to Use

- User a drop-down list to filter content on the current page or switch the type or option.

- On a drop-down list, mark the current option with a different color, and keep the arrow direction unchanged. When users touch one of the options, close the drop-down list and display the selected option on the list.


## Writing Instructions
