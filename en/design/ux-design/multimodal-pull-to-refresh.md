## How to Use

- Use the pull-to-refresh component when the content changes quickly and users need to refresh screens continuously to update the content.

- The loading animation is displayed during the pull-down process.

- When the minimum pull-down distance is not reached, the page directly bounces back after users lift their fingers.

- When the minimum pull-down distance is reached, the refresh animation is triggered after users lift their fingers. Only the loading animation is displayed, and no text is displayed.
