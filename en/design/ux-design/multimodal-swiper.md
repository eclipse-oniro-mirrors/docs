Page indicators show the number of pages in a series and tell user which page is currently displayed. They also allow users to switch between these pages.

## How to Use

- Use page indicators to display multiple equally important pages or content scenarios in sequence.

- Place page indicators below the content area.

- Use page indicators when the number of pages is small. The number of page indicators indicates the number of pages, and the highlighted page indicator indicates the position of the current page.

- Users can swipe the page indicators to switch between pages.

- Users can swipe left or right in the content area to easily switch between pages.

- Based on the carousel, the highlighted page indicator and the number of page indicators change accordingly.

- Carousel ads can be automatically displayed at an interval of 5 seconds.
