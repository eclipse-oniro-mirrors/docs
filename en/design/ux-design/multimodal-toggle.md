# Toggle


A toggle is used to enable or disable a function.

## How to Use


- Place a toggle on the right of a function for users to enable or disable the function.

- Turning on or off the toggle will change the setting status. In some scenarios, there is a delay in displaying the status from on to off or from off to on. For example, after a user turns on the toggle related to the Bluetooth function, it takes a certain period of time to enable the Bluetooth function, and the user may see a short change process.
