# Design Specifications


The design specifications document (generally in .pdf format) is used to describe common elements and change rules between UIs. This document is not mandatory in UX design deliverables. However, it frees designers from lots of repetitive work and helps developers quickly understand UX design specifications. Therefore, it is highly recommended in application design delivery in multi-device scenarios.


In multi-device scenarios, the design specifications document displays the effect of the same UI in different screen sizes side by side and describes the grid change rules.
