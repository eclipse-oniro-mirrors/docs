- Users can drag a scrollbar up and down or left and right to quickly browse information.

- When users access a page, dialog box, or any scrollable element where content exceeds the length of the display area, display a vertical scrollbar, which disappears after 2 seconds of user inactivity. 

- The height of a scrollbar is proportional to the amount of currently visible text in the entire document.
