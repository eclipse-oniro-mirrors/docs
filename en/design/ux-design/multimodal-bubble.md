Bubbles are lightweight tips that prompt users how to perform an operation. Generally, they do not affect user operations.

## How to Use

- Use bubbles when users access a screen for the first time. A bubble points to an element or area that is closely related and tells the user how to use a function.

- Show bubbles immediately upon user access.
