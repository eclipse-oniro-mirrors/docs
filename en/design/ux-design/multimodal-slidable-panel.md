# Panel

A panel is a lightweight window.


## How to Use

- Generally, use a panel at the bottom of the screen to facilitate one-hand operations.

- Adjust the position and display mode of panels in different scenarios, because the screen sizes of foldable phones and tablets are not suitable for one-hand actions. For example, the Share panel is displayed in the middle of the screen.

- The content displayed on panels depends on the scenario. Panels can be used to display the content that needs to be displayed persistently. For example, on an AI Touch screen, panels display the screen identification result. Panels can also be used to display the content that shows temporarily. For example, when a user looks up for a word, the meaning of the word is displayed on the panel.

- There are three sizes for a panel: small, medium (half screen), and large (full screen). The initial size is medium.
