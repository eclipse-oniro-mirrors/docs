# Fonts

Fonts directly impact the display effects of UIs and the reading efficiency of users. Excellent font design, unified multi-language font style, and correct typography can effectively improve application experience and convey brand continuity.


**Multi-Device Font Size Scales**


Choosing an appropriate font size helps define the information hierarchy and improve the readability of the content. Based on the study on the display environment of all-scenario devices and the usage differences in these environments, OpenHarmony leverages the layered parameters and defines a type scale system for constructing the information hierarchy for different device models.
