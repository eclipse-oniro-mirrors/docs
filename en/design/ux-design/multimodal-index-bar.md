# Index Bar


An index bar helps quickly locate a list sorted in alphabetical order.

## How to Use

- Use an index bar for quick and accurate locating.

- Use an index bar in both landscape and portrait orientations. If letters cannot be completely displayed in an index bar, use their abbreviated form.

- When a user touches a letter on the index bar, all items starting with this letter are displayed.

- Do not display the index bar if the content can be displayed on one screen.

- When a user swipes up or down on the index bar, the content displayed on the screen needs to scroll synchronously to match the letter position of the user's gesture on the index bar.
