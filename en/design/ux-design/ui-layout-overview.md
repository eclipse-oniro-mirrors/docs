# UI Layout Overview

UI layout should be dynamic. When the display environment (for example, device orientation, font size, or split-screen mode) changes, the content layout should adapt to the changes in a timely manner. For details on the concepts of layout basics, see [Layout Basics](grid-system.md).


This section also describes how to use adaptive and responsive layouts for better adaptation to the display environment. You can leverage the basic layout capability to implement multi-device adaptation for common page structures. For details, see [Layout Use Cases](ui-layout-cases.md).
