# Terminology
## A
### A2DP
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. This protocol is used to support transmission of high-quality audio, for example, listening to music with a Bluetooth headset.
### ACL
Asynchronous connectionless link. It is used to indicate the connection status of physical links between devices in the Bluetooth subsystem.
## B
### BLE
Bluetooth low energy. This protocol is supported since Bluetooth 4.0. Compared with traditional Bluetooth, BLE features low power consumption and long battery life.
### BR
Basic rate. It is a Bluetooth wireless communication technology representing traditional Bluetooth, which is mainly used in scenarios such as file and audio stream transmission.
### Bluetooth SIG
Bluetooth Special Interest Group, an organization that releases Bluetooth technical specifications. Developers can obtain detailed Bluetooth technical documentation from their official website.
## C
### Characteristic
Core data unit of the GATT service, which supports read/write operations and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## D
### Descriptor
Data unit of a GATT characteristic, which describes the characteristic's additional information and attributes. It supports read/write operations and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
## E
### EDR
Enhanced data rate. It is an enhanced version of BR that offers a higher data transmission rate. Together with BR, they are collectively referred to as traditional Bluetooth.
## G
### GATT
Generic Attribute Profile. It is the core protocol of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), defining the mechanism for Bluetooth communication and data transmission based on services, characteristics, and descriptors.
## H
### HFP
Hand Free Profile. This protocol is used to enable hands-free calling between Bluetooth devices, supporting bidirectional voice calls and control functions.
### HID
Human Interface Device Profile. This protocol enables low-latency bidirectional communication between Bluetooth-enabled human-computer interaction devices, such as transmitting data between keyboards, mice, and gamepads, and hosts like mobile phones, tablets, and PCs.
## M
### MAP
Message Access Profile. This protocol can be used to synchronize data such as SMS and emails between Bluetooth devices.
### MTU
Maximum transmission unit. It indicates the maximum size of a single data packet transmitted on the network, in bytes.
## P
### PAN
Personal Area Network. This protocol supports network sharing between devices.
### PBAP
Phone Book Access Profile. This protocol can be used to synchronize phone book data such as contacts and call logs between Bluetooth devices.
### Profile
Bluetooth technology protocol or capability in the Bluetooth subsystem, for example, A2DP, HFP, or HID.
## R
### RSSI
Received signal strength indicator. It is used in wireless communications to quantify the signal strength at the receiver in dBm.
## S
### Service
Service in the GATT protocol. It is a data structure containing multiple characteristics and dependent services. It represents a capability of a BLE device and is uniquely identified by a UUID.
### SPP
Serial Port Profile. This protocol can be used to implement connection and data transmission between Bluetooth devices.
## U
### UUID
Universally Unique Identifier, which is a 128-bit string. In Bluetooth technology, it is used to identify different profile protocols, as well as services, characteristics, and descriptors in the GATT protocol.
