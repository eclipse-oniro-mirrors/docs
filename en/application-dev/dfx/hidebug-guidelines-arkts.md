# Using HiDebug (ArkTS)

HiDebug provides multiple methods for debugging and profiling applications. With these methods, you can obtain memory, CPU, GPU, and GC data, collect process trace and profiler data, and dump VM heap snapshots. Since most APIs of this module are both performance-consuming and time-consuming, and are defined based on the HiDebug module, you are advised to use these APIs only during the application debugging and profiling phases. If the APIs are required in other scenarios, evaluate the impact of the APIs on application performance.

## How to Develop

The following describes how to add a button in the application and click the button to call the hidebug APIs.

1. Create a project, with **Empty Ability** as the template.

2. On the project configuration page, set **Model** to **Stage**.

3. In the **Project** window, click **entry &gt; src &gt; main &gt; ets &gt; pages** to open the **Index.ets** file.

   The following shows how to add **hidebug.getSystemCpuUsage()** to call the hidebug APIs. For details about how to use other APIs, see [API Reference](../reference/apis-performance-analysis-kit/js-apis-hidebug.md).

   ```ts
   import { hidebug } from '@kit.PerformanceAnalysisKit';
   import { BusinessError } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
   function testHiDebug(event?: ClickEvent) {
     try {
       console.info(`getSystemCpuUsage: ${hidebug.getSystemCpuUsage()}`);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`error code: ${(error as BusinessError).code}, error msg: ${(error as BusinessError).message}`);
     }
   }
   ```

   Add a click event to the **Text** component. The sample code is as follows:

   ```ts
   @Entry
   @Component
   struct Index {
     @State message: string = 'Hello World';

     build() {
       Row() {
         Column() {
           Text(this.message)
             .fontSize(50)
             .fontWeight(FontWeight.Bold)
             .onClick(testHiDebug);// Add a click event.
         }
         .width('100%')
       }
       .height('100%')
     }
   }
   ```

4. Run the project on a real device and click "Hello World" on the app/service.

5. At the bottom of DevEco Studio, switch to the **Log** tab and set the filter criteria to **testTag**.

   Then, the CPU usage logs obtained using **hidebug.getSystemCpuUsage()** are displayed in the window.
   ```Text
	08-20 11:06:01.891   1948-1948     A03d00/JSAPP                    com.examp...lication  I     getSystemCpuUsage: 0.4722222222222222
   ```
