# Analyzing App Freeze

Appfreeze occurs when an application does not respond a click event within a certain period of time. OpenHarmony provides a mechanism for detecting appfreeze and generates appfreeze logs for fault analysis.

> **NOTE**
> This guide applies only to applications in the stage model. Before using this guide, you must have basic knowledge about the JS applications, C++ program stacks, and application-related subsystems.

## AppFreeze Detection

Currently, appfreeze detection supports the fault types listed in the following table.

| Fault| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| THREAD_BLOCK_6S | The application main thread times out.|
| APP_INPUT_BLOCK | The user input response times out.|
| LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT | Ability lifecycle switching times out.|

### Application Main Thread Timeout

This fault indicates that the main thread of this application is suspended or too many tasks are executed, which affects task execution smoothness and experience.

Such a fault can be detected as follows: The watchdog thread of the application periodically inserts an activation detection to the main thread and inserts a timeout reporting mechanism to its own thread. If the activation detection is not executed within 3 seconds, the **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** event is reported. If the activation detection is not executed within 6 seconds, the **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** event is reported. The two events together form an appfreeze log.

The following figure shows the working principle.

![appfreeze_20230308145163](figures/appfreeze_20230308145163.png)

### User Input Response Timeout

This fault occurs when the system does not respond to a click event within 5 seconds.

Such a fault can be detected as follows: When a user clicks a button of the application, the input system sends a click event to the application. If the input system does not receive a response from the application within 5 seconds, a fault event is reported.

The following figure shows the working principle.

![appfreeze_20230308145162](figures/appfreeze_20230308145162.png)

### Lifecycle Switching Timeout

Lifecycle switching timeout refers to an [UIAbility Lifecycle](../application-models/uiability-lifecycle.md#uiability-lifecycle) switching timeout or a [PageAbility Lifecycle](../application-models/pageability-lifecycle.md#pageability-lifecycle) switching timeout.

The fault occurs during lifecycle switching and affects Ability switching and PageAbility switching of the application.

Such a fault can be detected as follows: Upon the start of a lifecycle switching process, the main thread inserts a timeout task to the watchdog thread, and then removes the timeout task when the lifecycle switching is complete. If the timeout task is not removed within a specific time frame, a fault event is reported.

The lifecycle switching timeout events consist of **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** and **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT**. **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** is used as the warning event of **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** to capture the Binder information.

![appfreeze_20230308145164](figures/appfreeze_20230308145164.png)

The timeout duration varies according to the lifecycle.

| Lifecycle| Timeout Duration|
| -------- | -------- |
| Load | 10s |
| Terminate | 10s |
| Connect | 3s |
| Disconnect | 0.5s |
| Foreground | 5s |
| Background | 3s |

## appfreeze Log Analysis

To identify the cause of appfreeze, analyze the appfreeze logs together with HiLog logs.

The following example shows an appfreeze log analysis. You can analyze the fault based on actual situation.

Appfreeze logs consist of header information, and general and specific information in the body.

### Header Information

| Field| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| Reason | Reason why the application does not respond. For details, see [appfreeze Detection](#appfreeze-detection).|
| PID | PID of the failed process, which can be used to search for related process information in the Hilog logs.|
| PACKAGE_NAME | Application process package name.|

### General Information in the Log Body

General information is present in all the aforementioned logs. It contains the fields listed in the following table. You can search for these fields to locate the related information in the log.

| Field| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| EVENTNAME | One or more fault events that constitute the cause of main thread freeze event.|
| TIMESTAMP | Time when the fault event reported. You can narrow down the time range to view HiLog logs based on the timeout duration described in [AppFreeze Detection](#appfreeze-detection).|
| PID | PID of the failed process, which can be used with the timestamp and timeout duration to search for related process information in the Hilog logs.|
| PACKAGE_NAME | Application process package name.|
| MSG | Dump information or description of the fault.|
| BinderCatcher | Information about IPC calls between a process and other system processes, such as the call waiting time.|
| PeerBinder Stacktrace | Information about stack trace of the peer process.|
| cpuusage | CPU usage of the device.|
| memory | Memory usage of the process.|

> **NOTE**
>
> When the entire system is heavily loaded, if the call stack is obtained in low-overhead mode or the stack capture times out, the function symbol and build-id information may be lost.

The **MSG** field includes the cause of the freeze event and task information in the main thread queue of the application.

The task information in the main thread queue includes:

- The running task and its start time. If the task start time is much earlier than the log report time, the running task causes the freeze event.

- Historical task time. If a new task cannot respond in time, you can check whether there are too many historical tasks based on historical task time.

- Tasks that are not executed in the stack.

**Example of the calling process stack:**

Locate the application stack information by searching for the **PID**. In the following stack, the window stays in the IPC communication phase when it sends events to the system through the IPC.

### Specific Information in the Log Body (Application Main Thread Timeout)

The value of **Reason** is **THREAD_BLOCK_6S**. According to [Application Main Thread Timeout](#application-main-thread-timeout), **THREAD_BLOCK** consists of **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** and **THREAD_BLOCK_6S**. By comparing the two parts, you can determine whether the appfreeze is due to a suspension or excessive tasks.

**THREAD\_BLOCK\_3S** is followed by **THREAD\_BLOCK\_6S** in the log. You can search for **EVENTNAME** to locate the two events in the log.

Both events contain the **MSG** field, which stores information about the processing queue of the main thread when the fault occurs. Hence, you can view the status of the event processing queue of the main thread at the two time points.

The example log shows that the event that started at **05:06:18.145** in the low-priority queue is running, and it is displayed in both the **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** and **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** logs. This indicates that the main thread suspension is not caused by excessive tasks.

Because **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** indicates a main thread suspension, you only need to analyze the stack information of the main thread (the ID of the main thread is the same as the process ID). In the example log, the main thread stack is run in the JS through ArkUI and therefore it can be concluded that the suspension occurs in the JS. Both **3S** and **6S** are stacks in this position, indicating that the JS is suspended. However, the cause is not that there are too many tasks.

```

Check the code being executed on the application side based on the Hilog log.

Generally, you can view the [General Information in the Log Body](#general-information-in-the-log-body) to determine the cause of an appfreeze event, including peer communication suspension, high CPU usage, memory leakage, or a large amount of memory.

### Specific Information in the Log Body (User Input Response Timeout)

The value of **Reason** is **APP_INPUT_BLOCK**, indicating that no response is received within 5 seconds after a click event.

You can find the event description in **MSG**.

For details, see [General Information in the Log Body](#general-information-in-the-log-body). Note that there is a high probability that the main thread is suspended in the case of no response to the user input. You can compare the stack and BinderCatcher information in two logs for further analysis. If there is no main thread suspended, it may indicate that there is a large number of other events before the input event. This may not cause a main thread suspension but can probably result in no response to user input.

### Specific Information in the Log Body (Lifecycle Switching Timeout)

Similar to **THREAD_BLOCK**, **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** consists of two parts, namely **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** and **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT**.

**MSG** indicates the lifecycle that encounters a timeout.

In the following example, **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** indicates that the process times out when **Ability** is switched to background. You can find Hilog information based on the timeout duration of [Lifecycle Switching Timeout](#lifecycle-switching-timeout).

LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT:

```
DOMAIN:AAFWK
STRINGID:LIFECYCLE
TIMEOUT TIMESTAMP:2023/03/10-17:06:53:65
PID:1561
UID:20010039
PACKAGE_NAME:com.ohos.huawei.myapplication
PROCESS_NAME:com.ohos.huawei.myapplication
MSG:ability:EntryAbility background timeout
```

For details about other log information, see [General Information in the Log Body](#general-information-in-the-log-body). Note that there is a high probability that the main thread is suspended during lifecycle switching. You can compare the stack and BinderCatcher information in two logs for further analysis.

## Application Exit

If any of the following faults occurs on an application, the application will be killed to ensure that the application can be recovered:

## Fault Analysis

To locate an appfreeze event, you need to obtain related logs such as fault logs, hilog logs, and trace logs.

### Obtaining the Log

The appfreeze log is managed together with the native process crash, JS application crash, and system process crash logs in the FaultLogger module. You can obtain the log in any of the following ways.

- Method 1: DevEco Studio

    DevEco Studio collects device fault logs and saves them to **FaultLog**. For details, see <!--RP1-->[DevEco Studio User Guide-FaultLog](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-fault-log-V5)<!--RP1End-->.

- Method 2: hiAppEvent APIs

    hiAppEvent provides APIs to subscribe to various fault information. For details, see [Introduction to HiAppEvent](hiappevent-intro.md).

<!--Del-->
- Method 3: Shell

    AppFreeze logs are stored in the device-specific **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/** directory. The log files are named in the format of **appfreeze-application bundle name-application UID-time (seconds)**.

Detection durations for different faults in different scenarios:

| THREAD_BLOCK_6S |APP_INPUT_BLOCK|LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT|
| -------- |--------|--------|
|Foreground application: 6s<br> Background application: 3s * 5 + 6s = 21s| 5s | Load: 10s<br> Active: 5s<br> Inactive: 0.5s<br> Terminate: 10s<br> Connect: 3s<br> Disconnect: 0.5s<br> Restart: 5s<br> Foreground: 5s<br> Background: 3s|

**NOTE**
1. The detection duration of **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** or **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** is half of that of **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** or **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT**. **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** and **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** are warnings and do not report logs independently. **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** and **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** are errors and report logs with the corresponding warning.
2. If **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** occurs in the foreground application, **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** will be triggered.
3. The value of **backgroundReportCount_** is **0**. When **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** occurs for five consecutive times (the count is not cleared), the **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** event is reported. Consequently, the detection durations of **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** and **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** are 18s and 21s respectively.

The fault occurrence time can be obtained based on the detection duration and the fault reporting time.

### Viewing **eventHandler** Information

You can search for the keyword **mainHandler dump is** to view the **eventHandler dump** information in logs.

1. dump begin curTime & Current Running

```
mainHandler dump is:
 EventHandler dump begin curTime: 2024-08-08 12:17:43.544      --> Time when dump begins.
 Event runner (Thread name =, Thread ID = 18083) is running    --> Information about the running thread.
 Current Running: start at 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, Event { send thread = 35882, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.628,  handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.630, task name = , caller = xx }  
 --> trigger time--> Time when the task starts to run.
```

Running duration of the current task = dump begin curTime – trigger time. In this example, the running duration of the current task is 27s.
If the task running duration is longer than the fault detection duration, the running task causes the application freeze event. In this case, you need to check the task.
If the current task running duration is short, the task is only one of the tasks running in the main thread within the detection duration and may not be the task that consumes most time. You are advised to check the task that consumes the longest time recently (in **History event queue information**). In this case, the watchdog cannot be scheduled because the thread is busy.

2. History event queue information

```
 Current Running: start at 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, Event { send thread = 35882, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.628, handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.630, task name = , caller = [extension_ability_thread.cpp(ScheduleAbilityTransaction:393)]}
 History event queue information:

 No. 1 : Event { send thread = 35854, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.525, handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.525, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.527, completeTime time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.527, priority = Low, task name = MainThread:SetRunnerStarted }
 No. 2 : Event { send thread = 35856, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.765, handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.765, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.766, completeTime time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.800, priority = Low, task name = MainThread:LaunchApplication }

 No. 4 : Event { send thread = 35854, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.794, handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:15.794, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, completeTime time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, priority = IDEL, task name = IdleTime:PostTask }
 No. 5 : Event { send thread = 35852, send time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, handle time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, trigger time = 2024-08-08 12:17:16.629, completeTime time = , priority = Low, task name =  }
```

You can search for time-consuming tasks in History event queue information. The task whose **completeTime time** is empty is the current task.
Task running duration = completeTime time – trigger time.
Filter out the tasks that take a longer time and check the running status of the tasks.

3. VIP priority event queue information

 ...
```

To ensure timely response to the user, all tasks in the user input event propagation are high-priority tasks. The VIP priority event queue is created by the system and records the transmission process of user input -> screen -> window -> ArkUI -> application. It is irrelevant to third-party application events and does not need to be concerned.

4. High priority event queue information

```
 High priority event queue information:

```

In the preceding example, the block queue is longer than the warning queue, but the first task does not change. The possible causes are as follows:
- The running task is suspended. As a result, other tasks are not scheduled and executed.
- Tasks in the queue with a higher priority are stacked. As a result, watchdog tasks in the queue with a lower priority are not scheduled.

Based on the trace information, check whether the called function of stack top times out.

```

In this case, the stacks are irregular because they are captured during thread running, which indicates that the thread is not suspended. If the thread is busy, analyze and optimize the application based on the trace and hilog logs.

### Viewing Binder Information

Obtain the Binder information after the warning event if it occurs, otherwise, obtain the Binder information after the block event.

1. Obtain the Binder information.

```
PeerBinderCatcher -- pid==35854 layer_ == 1
BinderCatcher --
    35854:35854 to 52462:52462 code 3 wait:27.185154163 s frz_state:3          -> 35854:35854 to 52462:53462 code 3 wait:27.185154163 s
    ...
    52462:52462 to 1386:0 code 13 wait:24.733640622 s frz_state:3              -> 52462:52462 to 1386:0 code 13 wait:24.733640622 s
```
This example shows that there is a call chain from the main thread of process 35854 to process 52462 and to process 1386. You can analyze the cause of the block event based on the stack information of the peer processes.

2. Check whether the thread ID is **0**.

When the thread ID of a process is **0**, it indicates that the application is IPC_FULL. That is, all IPC threads of the application are in use, and no other thread is allocated to the request. As a result, the request is blocked. For example, the thread ID of 1386 process is **0**, which can be analyzed based on its stack.

```
pid     context     request   started    max     ready   free_async_space

35862    binder      0          2        16       2         519984

35854    binder      0          2        16       3         520192

35850    binder      0          2        16       3         520192

13669    binder      0          1        16       3         520192

...

1386     binder      1          15       16       0         517264                 -> binderInfo

1474     binder      0          2        16       4         520192
```

As shown in the stack, the number of threads in the ready state of process 1386 is 0. This indicates that some IPC threads of the process may be blocked. To analyze why the IPC threads are not released, you can check the following causes: An IPC thread that holds the lock is blocked. As a result, other threads are suspended while waiting for the lock.

**free_async_space** is unavailable. As a result, there is no sufficient buffer space for the request of the new IPC thread. It should be noted that this value is required by both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Generally, **free_async_space** is unavailable when a large number of asynchronous requests are sent in a short period of time.

3. Check whether the value of **waitTime** is too small.

**waitTime** indicates the IPC duration. If the value of **waitTime** is far less than the fault detection duration, the suspension is not caused by the IPC request.
If the main thread on the application sends multiple IPC requests in a short period of time, the value of **waitTime** will be large. As a result, the thread is suspended.

In this case, you can check the following items:
    - Whether the wait time of a single request is as expected. If the wait time of a single request is greater than the normal value (for example, the request whose normal wait time is 20 ms waits for 1s), check why the API performance does not meet the expectation.
    - Whether the frequent calling on the application is proper.

4. Check whether there is no calling relationship and whether the stack is an IPC stack.

Check whether the stack is a temporary stack, that is, whether the warning stack is the same as the error stack. It is possible that the warning stack is an IPC stack, and the block stack is a temporary stack because the IPC request has ended when the binder is captured, and the IPC request takes a short time.
It should be noted that binder information is not obtained in real time when a fault occurs and is delayed. For faults that require half-period detection, binder information is accurately captured because most binder information can be collected within the fault period. For other faults, the off-site binder information may be captured when the reporting is delayed.

You can view the execution duration of the binder based on the trace.

### Analyzing Hilog logs

#### DFX-related Logs

1. Fault report (reportEvent):

![appfreeze_2024061401](figures/appfreeze_2024061401.png)

2. Stack capture (signal: 35):

![appfreeze_2024061402](figures/appfreeze_2024061402.png)

3. Background application check for five times before reporting, about 21s:

![appfreeze_2024061403](figures/appfreeze_2024061403.png)

4. Exit reason record:

![appfreeze_2024061404](figures/appfreeze_2024061404.png)

5. APP_FREEZE kills the application:

![appfreeze_2024061405](figures/appfreeze_2024061405.png)

#### Procedure

View [Obtain the fault occurrence time](#obtain-the-fault-occurrence-time), and determine the fault occurrence time based on the fault type. Analyze the hilog log in the specific period to obtain the status of the running thread.

- If no application log is printed, the application is frozen when the logging API is invoked.

   ![appfreeze_2024061406](figures/appfreeze_2024061406.png)

   **...**

   ![appfreeze_2024061407](figures/appfreeze_2024061407.png)

   As shown in the preceding figure, the **APP_INPUT_BLOCK** error is reported at **07:24:08.167**, and the application main thread does not print logs after **07:24:01.581**. Check whether the logic of **FormManagerService: **

   **[form_mgr_proxy.cpp(GetFormsInfoByApp:1128)]** times out.

- If the application logs are printed frequently, check whether the logs are normal.

   ![appfreeze_2024061408](figures/appfreeze_2024061408.png)

   As shown in the preceding figure, a large number of logs are printed before the process is killed by **APP_FREEZE**. Check whether the logs are normal in the **ImageEffect** domain.

### Analyzing Trace Logs

The possible causes are as follows:

1. The duration of each service is not long, but the number of services is too large.Therefore, the process runs intensively in a long period of time and occupies the main thread.

![appfreeze_2024061409](figures/appfreeze_2024061409.png)

![appfreeze_2024061410](figures/appfreeze_2024061410.png)

In the preceding figure, the **ohos.animator** in **PriviewArea::updateShotComponent** is executed for 9.2s.

The thread is busy executing a service cyclically and analyzing each service segment.

- If the service scenario is not normal (the service should not be called frequently), analyze the service code and find out why the service is executed cyclically.

- Otherwise, check whether the service segment takes more time than expected and why the performance does not meet the design specifications.

2. The process times out when executes a function.

![appfreeze_2024061411](figures/appfreeze_2024061411.png)

In the preceding figure, the execution duration of **OHOS::AppExecFwk::FormMgrAdapter::GetFormsInfoByApp** exceeds 8s.

## Case Study

### Typical Case of ThreadBlock - Incorrect Use of Locks

#### Background

The xxx service reports the appfreeze crash **THREAD_BLOCK_6S**.

#### Error Codes

The fourth line is locked, while the function in the sixth line fails and returns without unlocking. As a result, other threads are waiting for the locked function.

```cpp
int xxx()
{
    ...
    mutex_.lock();
    AIContext aiContext;
    if (ConvertRpcHandle2AIContext(inputs[0], aiContext) != aicp::SUCCESS) {
        return FAILED;
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Impact

The background application is suspended and related functions are unavailable, but it is imperceptible to the user.

#### Fault Locating

Extract the key fault logs.

```
appfreeze: com.huawei.hmsapp.xxx THREAD_BLOCK_6S at 20240408082432
DisplayPowerInfo:powerState:AWAKE
```

The value of **Foreground** indicates that **hiai** is a background application. Therefore, it can be inferred that when the 3s event is reported, the background application is suspended for **18s**.

```
Module name:com.xxx.xxx.xxx

```

The **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** event is reported at **08:24:29:612**.
The **THREAD_BLOCK_6S** event is reported at **08:24:32:638**. The interval is 3s as expected.

```

When the **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** event is reported, the **EventHandler** is captured at **08:24:29.413**. The cause is as expected: "App main thread is not response!" The main thread does not respond. The running task is send at **08:24:01.514**.

```

```

The watchdog task is in the high priority event queue. As shown in the following figure, a task is thrown to the main thread every 3 seconds, which is as expected.

The queue of **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** is similar to that of **THREAD_BLOCK_6S**, with one more event in the queue of **THREAD_BLOCK_6S**.

The earliest event is send at **08:24:11.388**, which is 18s earlier than the report time **08:24:29:612** as expected.

```

To sum up, the main thread of the application starts to run this task at **08:24:01.514**. The first **THREAD_BLOCK_3S** event occurs at **08:24:11.388**, and the application is suspended at about **08:24:11**.

View the main thread stack at **xxx_request_client.so -> libsamgr_proxy.z.so -> libipc_core.z.so(OHOS::BinderConnector::WriteBinder)**.

The main thread initiates an IPC request, but the peer process does not response. As a result, the process is suspended, as shown in the following stack.

The error code can be located by decompiling, and the use of the lock can be checked based on the context.

#### Solution

```cpp
int xxx()
{
    ...
    mutex_.lock();
    AIContext aiContext;
    if (ConvertRpcHandle2AIContext(inputs[0], aiContext) != aicp::SUCCESS) {
        return FAILED;
    }
    ...
}
```

Modify the preceding codes as follows:

```cpp
int xxx()
{
    ...
    AIContext aiContext;
    if (ConvertRpcHandle2AIContext(inputs[0], aiContext) != aicp::SUCCESS) {
        return FAILED;
    }
    mutex_.lock();
    ...
}
```

Adjust the lock properly based on the context.

#### Suggestions

1. Pay special attention to the timing and deadlock events during multi-thread interaction.

### Typical Case of **APP_INPUT_BLOCK** - Full Component Update

#### Background

When the theme is switched, the system is suspended, and the appfreeze fault of the sceneboard is reported.

This appfreeze fault occurs when the thread is busy.

#### Error Codes

Component update and reuse are controlled by the **key** value of the component. When a page is updated, if the **key** value of the component remains unchanged, the original component is reused. If the **key** value changes, the component and its subcomponents are updated.

This function is used to generate the **key** of the home screen component and is associated with **themeStyle**. When a user continuously switches the theme on the home screen, the component is repeatedly refreshed in full mode. As a result, the system stops responding.

```ts
private getForeachKey(item: xxx): string {
    ...
    return `${item.xxx2}${item.xxx2}...${item.themeStyle}`;
}
```

#### Impact

There is a high probability that the screen freezes when the theme is switched on the integrated home screen. When the user clicks, the screen does not respond and then returns to the lock screen, 

which severely affect user experience.

#### Fault Locating

Extract the key fault logs.

```
appfreeze: com.ohos.sceneboard APP_INPUT_BLOCK at 20240319022527

The reported cause: "User input does not respond!" There is no response to the user input event.
The running task of the main thread (TID = PID) starts at **14:40:53.499** and is not complete until the **Fault time** **14:40:58**.

```

User input events need to be responded immediately. Therefore, user input events are in the high priority event queue, together with the watchdog tasks.

In the following example, more than 200 input events are blocked in the queue and are not processed.

```

The input event triggers the main thread task of the application. However, the execution is not complete within 6 seconds and no response is returned. As a result, the ANR times out.
In this case, you only need to find out the task that the input triggers and why the task execution times out.

In the running main thread stack, the **ark_jsruntime GetCurrentThreadId** function at the stack top is not lock blocking or time-consuming. The captured stack is a transient stack that is useless for analysis.

Check the Hilog logs.

The **APP_INPUT_BLOCK** event is reported at about **13:40:59.448**, and then the DFX kills the suspended SCB.

![appfreeze_2024061412](figures/appfreeze_2024061412.png)

6 seconds before, a click event was sent to the SCB at about **14:40:53.498**.

![appfreeze_2024061413](figures/appfreeze_2024061413.png)

Within the 6 seconds, a large number of SCB logs are printed, showing that the SCB is re-rendering.

![appfreeze_2024061414](figures/appfreeze_2024061414.png)

Check the trace log within the 6 seconds.

It shows that the SCB main thread is fully occupied. The **CustomNodeUpdate SwiperPage** task takes a longer time. Therefore, you need to check why this component keeps refreshing.

It is found that **themeStyle** is added to the **key** on **swiperPage**. When the **key** value changes, a new control is created.

When a user switches the theme or icon style, all controls on the home screen are created. As a result, the main thread is busy and cannot respond the input event.

#### Solution

Trigger the home screen component refresh only when the home screen component style is switched, and narrow down the refresh scope.

```ts
+ if (!CheckEmptyUtils.isEmpty(themeStyleInfo.iconResourcePath) &&
+     themeStyleInfo.iconResourcePath !== this.themeStyle.iconResourcePath) {
+     this.isStyleChanged = true;
+     this.themeStyle.iconResourcePath = themeStyleInfo.iconResourcePath; --> themeStyle is associated with iconResourcePath.
+ }
```

#### Suggestions

The scope of page refresh triggered by a click event needs to be properly controlled. Avoid scenarios such as a large number of components need to be refreshed or a page needs to be refreshed frequently.

### Typical Case of **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** - Loading a Cloud Diagram

#### Background

When a user opens a cloud note, the application freezes and then crashes.

#### Error Codes

The cloud images are obtained synchronously in a loop.

```ts
public static xxxFunction(fileUris: string[]): void {
    ...
    for (const fileuril of fileUrils) {
        let file = fs.openSync(fileUri, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Impact

The application freezes and crashes when it is started or switched to the foreground.

#### Fault Locating

The following example extracts the key fault logs of **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** that occurs in notepad.

```
 sysfreeze: LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT at 20240201100459
```

The **MSG** information indicates that the timeout is in the foreground, and the duration is 5s.

```
MSG = 
Fault time:2024/02/01-10:04:57
ability:MainAbility foreground timeout.
server:
312522; AbilityRecord::ForegroundAbility; the ForegroundAbility lifecycle starts.
client:
312522; AbilityThread::ScheduleAbilityTransaction; the foreground lifecycle.
```

The **LIFECYCLE_HALF_TIMEOUT** event is reported at **10:04:57:538**.
The **LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT** event is reported at **10:04:59:965**. The interval of the two events is about 2.5s, which is as expected.

```

The preceding information indicates that the application loads files synchronously using the URI through **Open::Sync** and calls the **datashare()** to obtain media library file data.

The log information shows that the process is suspended when calls the **datashare()** to load the cloud diagram, which is consistent with the stack information.

![appfreeze_2024061416](figures/appfreeze_2024061416.png)

Check the code:

It is unreasonable to load **fileUri** synchronously in a loop. When the network is weak or a large amount of data is loaded at the same time, the application tends to be suspended. In this case, the application need to be modified.

#### Solution

Change the synchronous loading to asynchronous loading, use a flag to indicate whether the loading is complete and display the loading effect on the GUI.

```ts
public static xxxFunction(fileUris: string[]): void {
    ...
    for (const fileuril of fileUrils) {
        let file = fs.openSync(fileUri, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

Modify the preceding codes as follows:

```ts
public static async xxxFunction(fileUris: string[]): void {
    ...
    AppStorage.setOrCreate<boolean>('isLoadingPic', true); --> This function is used to display the page load effect.
    for (const fileuril of fileUrils) {
        let file = await fs.open(fileUri, fs.OpenMode.READ_ONLY);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Suggestions

1. Data on the cloud side must be fully verified in scenarios with good network, weak network, and no network.

2. Do not perform time-consuming operations in the application lifecycle function.
