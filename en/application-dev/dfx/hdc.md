2. Restart DevEco Studio.

**macOS**

1. Start the terminal tool and run the following command:

   ```shell
   echo $SHELL 
   ```

   - If the command output is **/bin/bash**, open the **.bash_profile** file.

      ```shell
      vi ~/.bash_profile
      ```

   - If the command output is **/bin/zsh**, open the **.zshrc** file.

      ```shell
      vi ~/.zshrc
      ```

2. Press **i** to enter **Insert** mode.
3. Enter the following content to add **HDC_SERVER_PORT** information to **PATH**.

   ```shell
   HDC_SERVER_PORT=7035
   launchctl setenv HDC_SERVER_PORT $HDC_SERVER_PORT
   export HDC_SERVER_PORT
   ```

4. Press **Esc** to exit **Insert** mode. Then enter **:wq** and press **Enter** to save the settings.
5. Run the following command for the environment variable to take effect.

   - If the **.bash_profile** file is opened in step 1, run the following command: 

      ```shell
      source ~/.bash_profile
      ```

   - If the **.zshrc** file is opened in step 1, run the following command:

      ```shell
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```

6. Restart DevEco Studio.

### (Optional) Setting Global Environment Variables

> **NOTE**
> If global environment variables are not set, you can run commands to go to the **toolchains** directory in the SDK and run hdc commands in the directory for debugging.

**Windows**

Choose **This PC > Properties > Advanced system settings > Advances > Environment Variables**, add the **toolchains** path of the SDK to the value of **Path**.

In the following example, the **toolchains** path of the local SDK is <!--RP1-->**/User/username/sdk/openharmony/10/toolchains**<!--RP1End-->.

**Linux/macOS**

1. Start the terminal tool and run the following command:

   ```shell
   echo $SHELL 
   ```

   - If the command output is **/bin/bash**, open the **.bash_profile** file.

      ```shell
      vi ~/.bash_profile
      ```

   - If the command output is **/bin/zsh**, open the **.zshrc** file.

      ```shell
      vi ~/.zshrc
      ```

2. Press **i** to enter **Insert** mode.

3. Enter the following content and add the SDK path to the **PATH**.

   In the following example, the **toolchains** path of the local SDK is <!--RP1-->**_/User/username/sdk/openharmony/10/toolchains_**<!--RP1End-->.

   ```shell
   HDC_SDK_PATH=/User/username/sdk/openharmony/10/toolchains
   launchctl setenv HDC_SDK_PATH $HDC_SDK_PATH # This command needs to be executed only on macOS.
   export PATH=$PATH:$HDC_SDK_PATH
   ```

4. Press **Esc** to exit **Insert** mode. Then enter **:wq** and press **Enter** to save the settings.

5. Run the following command for the environment variable to take effect.

   - If the **.bash_profile** file is opened in step 1, run the following command: 

      ```shell
      source ~/.bash_profile
      ```

   - If the **.zshrc** file is opened in step 1, run the following command:

      ```shell
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```
<!--Del-->
**(Optional for Linux) Granting USB Operation Permission for Non-root Users**

- To temporarily grant the full operation permission on a USB device, run the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/bus/usb/
   ```

- To permanently change the operation permission on a USB device, do as follows:

   1. Run the **lsusb** command to obtain the **vendorID** and **productID** of the USB device.

   2. Create an **udev** rule.

      Edit the **udev** loading rule and replace the default **idVendor** and **idProduct** values of the device with the values obtained in the previous step.

      **MODE="0666"** indicates the permissions of **GROUP** (the user group) for the USB device. Ensure that the login user is in the user group.

        ```shell
        sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/90-myusb.rules
        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
        ```

   3. Restart the computer or reload the **udev** rule.

        ```shell
        sudo udevadm control --reload
        ```

> **NOTE**
> A non-root user cannot find the device using hdc in Linux. Granting USB operation permission for non-root users can solve this problem. However, granting the full permission may pose potential security risks. You need to determine whether to grant the permission based on actual requirements.

## Precautions

- If an exception occurs, run the **hdc kill -r** command to kill the hdc process and restart the hdc service.

- If no device information is obtained after the **hdc list targets** command is executed, check whether the hdc process exists in the **Task Manager**. If the process exists, run the **hdc kill -r** command to kill the process and restart the hdc service.


## How to Use
> **NOTE**
>
> - The parameters enclosed in [] in a command are optional.
> - The parameters in italics are variables. Replace them with actual values when running the command.

## When to Use

### USB Connection

**Checking the Environment**
| Item| Normal| Exception Handling|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| USB debugging| USB debugging is enabled.| If the USB debugging mode is not automatically enabled, restart the device.|
| USB data cable connection| The PC used for debugging is connected to the device USB port using a USB cable.| If you use a USB cable with low bandwidth and no data communication function, the device may fail to be identified. You are advised to use an officially recommended USB cable.|
| USB port| A USB port on the mainboard (USB port on the rear panel of a desktop computer or USB port on a laptop computer) is used.| If you use a conversion adapter, docking station, or USB port on the front panel of a desktop computer, issues such as low bandwidth and USB sync problems may occur, which results in frequent disconnections. Therefore, direct connection between the PC and the device is recommended.|
| hdc environment variable| The help information is displayed after the **hdc -h** command is executed.| For details, see "Environment Setup".|
| Driver| After the device is connected via hdc, **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** is displayed in **Device Manager**.| Install the driver.|

**Procedure**

```shell
hdc shell // For USB direct connection, ensure that the device is not in TCP connection mode.
```

### TCP Connection

**Checking the Environment**
| Item| Normal| Exception Handling|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Network connection| The PC and the device are on the same network.| Connect the PC and device to the same Wi-Fi network or enable the Wi-Fi hotspot on your device.|
| Network Status| Use **telnet IP:port** to check that the network connection between the PC and the device is normal.| Connect the PC and the device over a stable network.|
| hdc environment variable| The help information is displayed after the **hdc** command is executed.| For details, see "Environment Setup".|

**Procedure**

1. Connect the PC to the device through a USB port.


2. Change the connection mode from USB mode to the TCP mode.

   ```shell
   hdc tmode port 8710// Add a port number after port. The default port number is 8710.
   ```

3. Connect to the device over TCP (the device IP address must be obtained in advance).

   ```shell
   hdc tconn IP:8710
   ```

   You can view the IP address on the device. The port number is the one specified in the previous step. The default port number is 8710.

4. Check the connection.

   ```shell
   hdc list targets
   ```

   If the return value is in the *IP:port* format, the connection is successful.

5. (Optional) Change the TCP mode to the USB mode.

   ```shell
   hdc tmode usb
   ```

   The USB mode is restored.

### Remote Connection

The following figure illustrates a remote connection.

![Remote connection structure](figures/hdc_image_004.PNG)

**Server Configuration**

Connect the server to the device using a USB cable and run the following commands:

```shell
hdc kill          // Terminate the local hdc service.
hdc -s IP:8710 -m // Enable the hdc service for network forwarding.
                  // In the command, IP indicates the IP address of the server. To query the IP address, you can run the ipconfig command on Windows and run the ifconfig command on Unix.
                  // 8710 is the default port number. You can also set it to another port number, for example, 18710.
                  // After startup, the server prints logs.
```

**Client Connection**

Ensure that the client can connect to the server IP address, and then run the following command:
```shell
hdc -s IP:8710 [command] // IP indicates the IP address of the server,
                         // and command can be any available hdc command, for example, list targets.
```

### Obtaining Logs

**Server logs**

Obtain server logs.

```shell
hdc kill ​
hdc -l5 start
```

The collected logs are stored in the following path.

| OS| Path| Remarks|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Windows | %temp%\hdc.log | The following is an example. Replace *Username* with the actual one.<br/>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\hdc.log |
| Linux | /tmp/hdc.log | - |
| MacOS | $TMPDIR/hdc.log | - |

**Device Logs**

Enable HiLog to obtain the corresponding logs.

```shell
hdc shell hilog -w start                             // Enable the function of storing HiLog logs.
hdc shell ls /data/log/hilog                     // View the stored HilLog logs.
hdc file recv /data/log/hilog                  // Obtain the stored HilLog logs (including kernel logs).
```

## FAQs

### Failed to Identify the Target Device

**Symptom**

After the **hdc list targets** command is executed, the command output is **[empty]**.

Perform the following operations to locate the fault.

- Case 1: Check whether the target device is displayed in **Device Manager**.

  Windows:

  Check whether **HDC Device** (for a single-port device) or **HDC Interface** (for a composite device) exists under **Universal Serial Bus Controllers** in **Device Manager**.

  Linux:

  Run the **lsusb** command. Check whether **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** is displayed in the command output.

  macOS:

  View USB devices in **System Information** or **System Overview**.

  1. Press and hold the **Option** key, and click **Menu**.

  2. Choose **System Information** or **System Overview**.

  3. Select **USB** on the left.

  4. Check whether **HDC Device** or **HDC Interface** exists in the device tree.

  **Solution**

  If the device is not displayed, it fails to be identified. You can use any of the following methods to resolve the problem:

  - Use another physical USB port.
  - Replace the USB cable.
  - Use another PC for debugging.
  - Enable the USB debugging mode.
  - Click **OK** to allow USB debugging.
  - If a TCP connection can be set up, run the **hdc tmode usb** command to switch to the USB connection.
  - Restore the factory settings of the device.

- Case 2: A USB device exists, but the driver is damaged. **HDC Device** with a warning icon in yellow is displayed.

  This problem usually occurs in Windows. In **Device Manager/Universal Serial Bus Device**, **HDC Device** is displayed with a yellow warning icon, indicating that the device cannot work properly. To resolve the problem, reinstall the driver. If the problem persists, use another USB cable, docking station, or USB port.

  **Reinstalling the Driver**

  1. Open **Device Manager**, and right-click the **HDC Device** with a warning icon.

  2. In the displayed menu, choose **Update driver**.

  3. In the first prompt window, select **Browse my computer for drivers**.

  4. In the second prompt window, select **Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer**.

  5. In the third prompt window, deselect **Show compatible hardware**, select **WinUsb Device** for **Manufacture** and **WinUsb Device** for **Model**, and click **Next**.

- Case 3: "[Fail]Failed to communicate with daemon" is displayed when the device is connected. 

  When "[Fail]Failed to communicate with daemon" is displayed after a hdc command is executed.

  Possible causes are as follows:

  - The hdc or SDK does not match the device. If the device is the latest version, update the hdc or SDK tool to the latest version.
  - The port is occupied.

    This problem usually occurs when hdc and hdc_std use the same **HDC_SERVER_PORT** or the same default port **8710**. Ensure that either hdc or hdc_std is running. This problem also occurs when other software occupies the default hdc port.

- Case 4: "Connect server failed" is displayed when the device is connected.

  The possible causes are as follows:

  - **Port Preemption**

    Solution:
    1. Check the software processes that come with hdc, including software with built-in hdc, such as DevEco Studio and DevEco Testing.

       Stop these software processes and run hdc commands.

    2. Check hdc port status.

       For example, if **HDC_SERVER_PORT** is set to **8710**, run the following command to check the port status.

       Unix:

       ```shell
       netstat -an |grep 8710
       ```

       Windows:

       ```shell
       netstat -an |findstr 8710
       ```

       If the port is used by another software, stop the software process or change the **HDC_SERVER_PORT** environment variable to another port number.

    3. Check for and stop the hdc server of another version.

       Windows:

       Choose **Task Manager** > **Details**, right-click the **hdc.exe** process and choose **Open file location**. Check whether the location is the same as that configured in the environment variable. If not, stop the **hdc.exe** process by running the **hdc kill** command or terminating the process in **Task Manager**. Then, run the hdc command again. (The hdc server will be restarted by running the hdc command.)

       Unix:

       Run the **ps -ef |grep hdc** command to query the hdc server process running in the background and check whether the process startup location is the hdc file location set by the environment variable **Path**. If not, stop the hdc process by running the **hdc kill** or **kill -9 hdc** *PID* command, and run the hdc command again. (The hdc server will be restarted by running the hdc command.)

  - **Registry Exception**

    Solution: Clear the registry. The procedure is as follows:

    1. Press **Win+R** to open the **Run** dialog box, and enter **regedit** to open the registry.
    2. Enter the following address in the address bar, and press **Enter** to access the registry of the USB device driver.

       ```shell
       Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{88bae032-5a81-49f0-bc3d-a4ff138216d6}
       ```

    3. Right-click **UpperFilters** and choose **Edit**. Back up and clear the value data. The backup data can be used to restore the value data if the problem persists.
    4. Refresh the **Device Manager**, remove and reconnect the USB cable to the USB port, or restart the PC.

### Failed to Run hdc

**Symptom**

The **hdc.exe**/hdc binary file cannot be executed using the CLI.

**Possible Causes and Solution**

- Incorrect runtime environment.

  Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit or later is recommended. If **libc++.so** reference errors are reported, run the **ldd** or **readelf** command to check library reference.

  macOS: macOS 11 or later is recommended.

  Windows: Windows 10 or Windows 11 64-bit is recommended. If the WinUSB library or driver is missing in an earlier version, use [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases) to update it. For Windows 10 or Windows 11 64-bit, use [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases) to install the libusb-win32 driver. For details, see [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases).

- Improper running mode: Use the correct command to run the hdc tool instead of double-clicking the file.

### Common Procedure for Troubleshooting Other Problems

1. Run the **hdc list targets** command.
2. Check whether **HDC Device** exists in **Device Manager**.
3. Run the **hdc kill** command to terminate the server, and then run the **hdc -l5 start** command to collect logs. The **hdc.log** file is stored in the **TEMP** directory on the execution end. The specific directory varies with the OS. For details, see [Obtaining Logs](#obtaining-logs).
4. Locate the problem based on the **hdc.log** file.
