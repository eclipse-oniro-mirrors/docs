# Analyzing Cpp Crash

A cpp crash refers to a process crash in C/C++ application. The FaultLogger module provides capabilities such as process crash detection, log collection, log storage, and log reporting, helping you to locate faults more effectively.

The following introduces cpp crash detection, crash fault locating and analysis, and typical cases. To use this guideline, you need to have basic knowledge about stack and heap in C/C++.

## Cpp Crash Detection

Process crash detection is based on the posix signal mechanism. Currently, the exception signals that can be processed are as follows:

| Signo| Signal| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 4 | SIGILL | Invalid instruction| An invalid, incorrectly formatted, unknown, or privileged instruction is executed.|
| 5 | SIGTRAP | Breakpoint or trap| An exception occurs or a trap instruction is executed.|
| 6 | SIGABRT | Process abort| The process is aborted abnormally. Generally, this exception occurs when the process calls **abort()** in the Standard Function Library.|
| 7 | SIGBUS | Illegal memory access| The process accesses an aligned or nonexistent physical address.|
| 8 | SIGFPE | Floating-point exception| An incorrect arithmetic operation is executed, for example, a 0 divisor, floating point overflow, or integer overflow.|
| 11 | SIGSEGV | Invalid memory access| The process accesses an invalid memory region.|
| 16 | SIGSTKFLT | Stack error| The processor performs an incorrect stack operation, such as a pop when the stack is empty or a push when the stack is full.|
| 31 | SIGSYS | Incorrect system call| An incorrect or invalid parameter is used in a system call.|

Some of the preceding fault signals are classified into codes based on specific scenarios.
**SIGILL** occurs in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It indicates an invalid instruction exception. The **SIGILL** signal is usually triggered by the following causes:
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | ILL_ILLOPC | Illegal operation code| A privileged instruction or an instruction that is unsupported by the CPU is executed.|
| 2 | ILL_ILLOPN | Illegal operand| An incorrect operand or improper operand type is used.|
| 3 | ILL_ILLADR | Illegal address| A program accesses an invalid memory address or an unaligned memory address.|
| 4 | ILL_ILLTRP | Illegal trap| A program performs an illegal trap instruction or an undefined operation.|
| 5 | ILL_PRVOPC | Illegal privileged operation code| A common user executes a privileged instruction.|
| 6 | ILL_PRVREG | Illegal privileged register| A common user accesses a privileged register.|
| 7 | ILL_COPROC | Illegal coprocessor| A program performs an undefined coprocessor instruction.|
| 8 | ILL_BADSTK | Illegal stack| A program performs an operation at an invalid stack address, or when the stack overflows.|

**SIGTRAP** usually occurs in debugging and tracking. The four scenarios of the **SIGTRAP** signal are described as follows.
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | TRAP_BRKPT | Software breakpoint| The software breakpoint is reached in a program. When debugging a program, a software breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values.|
| 2 | TRAP_TRACE | Single-step debugging| A single instruction is executed in a program. Single instruction can be used to check the execution result of each instruction.|
| 3 | TRAP_BRANCH | Branch Tracing| A branch instruction is executed in a program. Branch instruction can be used to control the execution process of a program, such as if statements and loop statements.|
| 4 | TRAP_HWBKPT | Hardware breakpoint| The hardware breakpoint is reached in a program. When debugging a program, a hardware breakpoint at the key position can be used to pause the program execution and check information such as variable values. Different from a software breakpoint, a hardware breakpoint is implemented in CPU hardware. Therefore, whether a hardware breakpoint is triggered can be detected in real time during program execution.|

The **SIGBUS** signal is sent by the operating system to a process. It usually indicates a memory access error. The codes of the **SIGBUS** signal are described as follows:
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | BUS_ADRALN | Unaligned memory address| A program accesses an unaligned memory address, for example, a non-even address of a 4-byte integer.|
| 2 | BUS_ADRERR | Invalid memory address| A program accesses a memory address that does not exist in the Process Address Space, such as a null pointer.|
| 3 | BUS_OBJERR | Invalid object access| A program accesses an object that is deleted or not initialized.|
| 4 | BUS_MCEERR_AR | Invalid hardware memory check| A checksum error is detected when the hardware memory is accessed.|
| 5 | BUS_MCEERR_AO | Invalid hardware memory check| An address check error is detected when the hardware memory is accessed.|

The **SIGFPE** signal indicates a floating-point exception or an arithmetic exception. The codes of the **SIGFPE** signal are described as follows:
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | FPE_INTDIV | Invalid integer division| The divisor in an integer division is zero.  |
| 2 | FPE_INTOVF | Integer overflow| The divisor in an integer division is negative.  |
| 3 | FPE_FLTDIV | Invalid floating-point division| The divisor in a floating-point division is zero.  |
| 4 | FPE_FLTOVF | Floating-point overflow| The divisor in a floating-point division is negative.  |
| 5 | FPE_FLTUND | Floating-point underflow| The divisor in a floating-point division is zero.  |
| 6 | FPE_FLTRES | Invalid floating-point result| The divisor in a floating-point division is positive.  |
| 7 | FPE_FLTINV | Invalid floating-point operation| The divisor in a floating-point division is negative.  |
| 8 | FPE_FLTSUB | Floating-point trap| The divisor in a floating-point division is zero.  |

The **SIGSEGV** signal occurs when a process accesses a non-existent memory address or an inaccessible address. The codes of the **SIGSEGV** signal are described as follows:
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | SEGV_MAPERR | Non-existent memory address| A process accesses a memory address that does not exist or that is not mapped to the Process Address Space. This exception is usually caused by pointer errors or memory leaks.|
| 2 | SEGV_ACCERR | Inaccessible memory address| A process accesses an inaccessible memory address marked by the operating system, such as a read-only memory address or a memory address without execution permission. This exception is usually caused by buffer overflow or modifying read-only memory.|

The classification of codes cannot only be based on **signo**, but also be based on the causes of the signal. The preceding describes the codes classified based on the **signo** of each signal, while the following describes the codes classified based on causes of all signals:
| No.| Code| Description| Trigger Cause|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 | SI_USER | User space signal|This signal is sent by a process in user space to another process, usually using the **kill()**. For example, when a user presses **Ctrl+C** on the terminal, a **SIGINT** signal is sent to all foreground processes.|
| 0x80 | SI_KERNEL | Kernel signal|This signal is sent by the kernel to the process. It is usually sent when the kernel detects some errors or exceptions. For example, when a process accesses an invalid memory address or executes an invalid instruction, the kernel sends a **SIGSEGV** signal to the process.|
| -1 | SI_QUEUE | **sigqueue()** signal|This signal is sent by **sigqueue()**, and an additional integer value and a pointer can be carried. It is usually used for advanced communication between processes, such as transferring data or notifying a process that an event occurs.|
| -2 | SI_TIMER | Timer signal|This signal is sent by a timer and is usually used to execute a scheduled task or a periodic task. For example, when a timer expires, the kernel sends a **SIGALRM** signal to the process.|
| -3 | SI_MESGQ | Message queue signal|This signal is sent by a message queue and is usually used for communication across processes. For example, when a process sends a message to a message queue, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the receiving process.|
| -4 | SI_ASYNCIO | Asynchronous I/O signal|This signal is sent by an asynchronous I/O and is usually used for a non-blocking I/O. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the process.|
| -5 | SI_SIGIO | Synchronous I/O signal|This signal is sent by a synchronous I/O and is usually used for a non-blocking I/O. For example, when an I/O operation on a file descriptor is complete, the kernel sends a **SIGIO** signal to the process.|
| -6 | SI_TKILL | **tkill()** signal|This signal is sent by the function **tkill()**, which is similar to the function **kill()**. In addition, you can specify the ID of the thread that sends the signal. It is usually used to send a signal to a specified thread in a multithreaded program.|

## Fault Analysis

### Crash Log Collection

The process crash log is managed together with the app freeze and JS crash logs by the FaultLogger module. You can obtain process crash logs using any of the following methods:

- Method 1: DevEco Studio

    DevEco Studio collects process crash logs from **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/** to FaultLog, where logs are displayed by process name, fault, and time. For details about how to obtain logs, see <!--RP1-->[DevEco Studio User Guide-FaultLog](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-fault-log-V5)<!--RP1End-->.

- Method 2: hiAppEvent APIs

    hiAppEvent provides APIs to subscribe to various fault logs. For details, see [Introduction to HiAppEvent](hiappevent-intro.md).

<!--Del-->
- Method 3: Shell

    - When a process crashes, you can find fault logs in **/data/log/faultlog/temp/** on the device. The log files are named in the format of **cppcrash-process PID-timestamp (millisecond)**. They contain information such as the process crash call stack, process crash register, stack memory, maps, and process file handle list.

        ![cppcrash-temp-log](figures/20230407111853.png)

    - You can find more comprehensive fault logs in **/data/log/faultlog/faultlogger/**, which include information such as device name, system version and process logs. The log files are named in the format of **cppcrash-process name-process UID-time (second)**.

**Fault Logs of Null Pointer**
In this scenario, a message is printed in the log, indicating that the fault may be caused by null pointer dereference.
The following is the core content of a process crash log archived by DevEco Studio in FaultLog. The content is the same as that archived in /**data/log/faultlog/faultlogger**.

**Fault Logs of Stack Coverage**
In the stack coverage scenario, the stack frame cannot be traced because the stack memory is illegally accessed. A message is displayed in the log, indicating that the stack fails to be returned and the system attempts to parse the thread stack to obtain an unreliable call stack. The information is provided for problem analysis. The key logs are as follows:

### Locating the Problematic Code Based on the Crash Stack

#### Method 1: DevEco Studio

In application development, you can locate the problematic code in the cppcrash stack of the dynamic library. Both native stack frames and JS stack frames are supported. For some stack frames that fail to be parsed and located in DevEco Studio, refer to Method 2.

![cppcrash-addr2line1](figures/cppcrash_image_002.png)

#### Method 2: SDK llvm-addr2line

- Obtain the symbol list
    Obtain the .so file with symbols in the crash stack, which should be the same as that of the application or system.
    Compiled and built in DevEco Studio, the .so file of dynamic library is generated with symbols by default in **/build/default/intermediates/libs**. You can run the **Linux file** command to check whether the BuildID of two .so files match. Generated by a compiler, BuildID is the unique identifier of a binary file, in which "not stripped" indicates that a symbol table is included.

    ```
    $ file libbabel.so
    libbabel.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=fdb1b5432b9ea4e2a3d29780c3abf30e2a22da9d, with debug_info, not stripped
    ```

    Note: The symbol table of the system dynamic library is archived with the version.

- Locate the line number using llvm-addr2line
    You can find llvm-addr2line in **[SDK DIR PATH]\OpenHarmony\11\native\llvm\bin**, or you need to search for the path as it varies based on the SDK version. 
    The sample stack is as follows (part are omitted):

    Parsed by SDK llvm-addr2line, the row number of problematic code is as follows:

    TrggerCrash(napi_env__*, napi_callback_info__*)
    D:/code/apprecovery-demo/entry/src/main/cpp/hello.cpp:48
    ```

    You can use the **llvm-addr2line.exe -fCpie libutils.z.so offset** command to parse the stack line by line. If there are multiple offsets, you can parse them together using the **llvm-addr2line.exe -fCpie libxxx.so 0x1bc868 0x1be28c xxx** command. If the obtained row number does not seem correct, you can change the address (for example, subtract 1) or disable some compilation optimization.

#### Method 3: DevEco Studio hstack

hstack is a tool provided by DevEco Studio for you to restore the crash stack of an obfuscated release app to the source code stack. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For details, see [DevEco Studio hstack User Guide](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-command-line-hstack-V5).

### Reviewing Code Based on Services

Review the context after the row number of the stack top is obtained. As shown in the following figure, line 48 in the **hello.cpp** file indicates a null pointer dereference.

![cppcrash-demo1](figures/cppcrash_image_004.png)

This example is constructed, and actual scenario is usually more complicate and needs to be analyzed based on services.

### Disassembling (optional)

Generally, if the problem is clear, you can locate the problem by decompiling the code line. In a few cases, if the method called in a line contains multiple parameters and the parameters involve structs, you need to use disassembly for further analysis.

```
objdump -S xxx.so > xxx.txt
objdump -d xxxx                    Disassembles the xxxx file.
objdump -S -l xxxx                 Disassembles the xxxx file and display the source code line.
```

### Common CppCrash Faults and Causes

- Null pointer dereference
    When a crash log is in format **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@0x00000000** or the values of the input parameter registers such as **r0** and **r1** printed in the **Register** are **0**, check whether a null pointer is input when invoking a method.
    When a crash log is in format **SIGSEGV(SEGVMAPERR)@0x0000000c** or the value of the input parameter register such as **r1** printed in the **Register** is small, check whether the called structs contain a null pointer.
- SIGABRT
    Generally, this fault is triggered by the user, framework, or C library, and you can locate the problematic code in the first frame of the framework library. In this case, check whether resources such as thread and file descriptor are properly used, and whether the invoking sequence of APIs is correct.
- SIGSEGV
  - Multithreading operation collection in STD library is not thread-safe. If the collection is added or deleted on multiple threads, the **SIGSEGV** crash occurs. If **llvm-addr2line** is used and the result code involve operations on collections, this could be the reason for the crash.
  - If the pointer does not match the lifecycle of an object, for example, using a raw pointer to store the **sptr** type and **shared_ptr** type, can lead to memory leak and dangling pointer. A raw pointer is a pointer that does not have features such as encapsulation and automatic memory management. It is only a simple pointer to the memory address. The memory to which the pointer points is not protected or managed. A raw pointer can directly access the pointed memory, but problems such as memory leak and null pointer reference may also occur. Therefore, when using a raw pointer, pay attention to potential security problems. You are advised to use smart pointers to manage memory.
- Use after free
    This fault occurs when the reference of a released stack variable is not set to null and the access continues.

    ```
    # include <iostream>

    int& getStackReference() {
        int x = 5;
        return x; // Return the reference to x.
    }

    int main() {
        int& ref = getStackReference (); // Obtain the reference to x.
        // x is released when getStackReference() returns.
        // ref is now a dangling reference. If you continue to access it, undefined behavior occurs.
        std::cout << ref << std::endl; // Outputting the value of x is an undefined behavior.
        return 0;
    }
    ```

- Stack overflow occurs in recursive invocation, mutual invocation of destructors, and the use of large stack memory blocks in special stacks (signal stacks).
    ```
    # include <iostream>

    class RecursiveClass {
    public:
        RecursiveClass() {
            std::cout << "Constructing RecursiveClass" << std::endl;
        }

        ~RecursiveClass() {
            std::cout << "Destructing RecursiveClass" << std::endl;
            // Recursive invocation of a destructor.
            RecursiveClass obj;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        RecursiveClass obj;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    When a **RecursiveClass** object is created, its constructor is called. When this object is destroyed, its destructor is called. In the destructor, a new **RecursiveClass** object is created, which causes recursive calls until the stack overflows. Recursive calls are infinite. As a result, the stack space is used up and the application crashes.
- Binary mismatch usually indicates the mismatch of the Application Binary Interface (ABI). For example, when a compiled binary interface or its data structure definition does not match the ABI, a random crash stack is generated.
- Memory corruption occurs when the memory of a valid wild pointer is changed to an invalid value, which results in out-of-bounds access and data overwrite. In this case, a random crash stack is generated.
- SIGBUS (Aligment) occurs when the address is in the unaligned state after the pointer is forcibly converted.

## Case Study

The following analyzes the typical CppCrash cases based on signals, scenarios, and tools respectively.
The analysis based on signals introduces common crash signals and provides a typical case for each type of signal.
The analysis based on scenarios concludes a common scenario for frequent problems, and provides a typical case for each scenario.
The analysis based on tools describes how to use various maintenance and debugging tools, and provides a typical case for each tool.

### Analyzing CppCrash Based on Signals

#### Type 1: SIGSEGV Crash

The **SIGSEGV** signal indicates a Segmentation Fault of the program. This fault occurs when a program accesses a memory area outside its bounds (for example, writes a memory in the operating system), or accesses a memory area without correct permission (for example, writes to read-only memory). The details are as follows:

- **SIGSEGV** is a type of memory management fault.
- **SIGSEGV** is generated in a user-mode program. 
- **SIGSEGV** occurs when a user-mode program accesses a memory area outside its bound.
- **SIGSEGV** also occurs when a user-mode program accesses a memory without correct permission.

In most cases, **SIGSEGV** is caused by pointer overwriting. However, not all pointer overwriting causes **SIGSEGV**. The **SIGSEGV** crash would not be triggered unless an out-of-bounds pointer is dereferenced. In addition, even if an out-of-bounds pointer is dereferenced, the **SIGSEGV** crash may not be caused. The **SIGSEGV** crash involves the operating system, C library, compiler, and linker. The examples are as follows:

- The memory area is read-only memory.
    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
        char *s = "hello world";
        s[1] = 'H';
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    This is one of the most common examples. In this case, "hello world" is a constant string and is placed in **.rodata section** of GCC. When the target program is generated, **.rodata section** is merged into the **text segment** and placed together with the **code segment**. Therefore, the memory area where the **.rodata section** is located is read-only. This is the **SIGSEGV(SEGV_ACCERR)** crash caused by writing to read-only memory area.

    ![cppcrash-demo2](figures/cppcrash_image_005.png)

- The memory area is out of the process address space.

    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
        uint64_t* p = (uint64_t*)0xffffffcfc42ae6f4;
        *p = 10;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In this example, the program accesses a memory address in the kernel. The **SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@0xffffffcfc42ae6f4** crash is usually triggered by the program by accident. The key logs of this cpp crash are as follows:

    ```

3. The memory does not exist.
    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
        int *a = NULL;
        *a = 1;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In practice, the most common null pointer dereference occurs when the user-mode address to which the null pointer points does not exist. The inference information "Reason:Signal:SIGSEGV(SEGV_MAPERR)@000000000000000000 probably caused by NULL pointer dereference" is printed in the **Reason** of CppCrash logs, as shown in the following figure.

    ![cppcrash-demo3](figures/cppcrash_image_006.png)

4. Double free.
    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
        void *pc = malloc(1024);
        free(pc);
        free (pc); // Double free
        printf("free ok!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In the double-free memory scenario, the system throws a **SIGSEGV(SI_TKILL)** fault indicating an illegal memory operation, as shown below

    ![cppcrash-demo3](figures/cppcrash_image_007.png)

    The preceding are common causes for **SIGSEGV** crashes. Other scenarios may also trigger **SIGSEGV** crashes, which include stack overflow memory access, heap overflow memory access, global wild pointer access, execution on an invalid address, and invalid parameter invocation. The **SIGSEGV** crash is associated to the stack allocation and recovery of the operating system and the compiler. 

#### Type 2: SIGABRT Crash

The **SIGABRT** signal is sent to abort the process. This signal can be called by the process executing **abort()** in C standard library, or it can be sent to the process from outside like other signals. 

- Executing the **abort()** function.
    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
        OH_LOG_FATAL(LOG_APP, "test fatal log.");
        abort();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In this scenario, the **abort()** function is proactively called when a process is identified as not safe in checks from basic libraries. The last fatal log before the process exits is printed in the crash log, as shown in the following figure:

    ![cppcrash-demo4](figures/cppcrash_image_008.png)

- Executing the **assert()** function.
    The sample code is as follows:

    ```
    static napi_value TriggerCrash(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
    {
    # if 0 // If the value is 0, an error is reported. If the value is 1, it is normal.
        void *pc = malloc(1024);
    # else
        void *pc = nullptr;
    # endif
        assert(pc != nullptr);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In addition to the **abort()** function, other exception handling mechanisms in C++ include the **assert()** function, **exit()** function, exception capture mechanism (**try-catch**), and **exception** class. The **assert()** function is used to check some data in the function execution. If the check fails, the process aborts. The corresponding fault scenario is shown below. 

    ![cppcrash-demo5](figures/cppcrash_image_009.png)

### Analyzing CppCrash Based on Scenarios

#### Type 1: Memory Access Crash

**Background**
The crash address **0x7f82764b70** is in the readable and executable segment of **libace_napi_ark.z.so**. The cause is that the address needs to be written, but the corresponding **maps** segment has only the read and execute permissions. In other words, when a process attempts to access a memory area that is not allowed to be accessed, the process crashes.

```
7f82740000-7f8275c000 r--p 00000000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
7f8275c000-7f8276e000 r-xp 0001b000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so <- The crash address locates within this address range.
7f8276e000-7f82773000 r--p 0002c000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
7f82773000-7f82774000 rw-p 00030000 /system/lib64/libace_napi_ark.z.so
```

The following figure shows the crash call stack.

![cppcrash-demo6](figures/cppcrash_image_010.png)

**Fault Analysis**
This address error is regular, but it is abnormal that the node address fall in **libace_napi_ark.z.so**. In this case, this may be memory corruption error. You can use [ASan Check](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-asan-V5) to locate the memory corruption error. By performing stress tests to reproduce the problem, ASan can also be used to find the regular crash scenario. The fault detected by ASan is the same as that in the crash stack above. The stack reports **heap-use-after-free**, which was actually a double free of the same address. During the second free operation, the address is used to access to its object member, resulting in a UAF fault. 
The key logs of ASan are as follows:

```

Continue the analysis based on the stack.
When **JsiWeak** is destructed or reset, **CopyableGlobal** in the parent class **JsiType** of its member (**JsiObject**/**JsiValue**/**JsiFunction**) is released, as shown in the following figure.

![cppcrash-demo5](figures/cppcrash_image_011.png)

During Garbage Collection (GC), **IterateWeakEcmaGlobalStorage** calls **DisposeGlobalHandle** on **WeakNode** without a callback, and releases it, as shown in the following figure.

![cppcrash-demo6](figures/cppcrash_image_012.png)

Therefore, for the same **WeakNode**, there may be two functions for release. If **IterateWeakEcmaGlobalStorage** releases it first during GC, without a callback notification to **JsiWeak** for cleanup, **JsiWeak** still retains a reference **CopyableGlobal** to the released **WeakNode**. When the **NodeList** containing the **WeakNode** is released and returned to the operating system, the retained **CopyableGlobal** in **JsiWeak** is released again, leading to a double-free error. 

![cppcrash-demo7](figures/cppcrash_image_013.png)

**Solutions**
Invoke a callback when **JsiWeak** calls **SetWeakCallback**. Therefore, the callback can notify **JsiWeak** to reset **CopyableGlobal** when **IterateWeakEcmaGlobalStorage** releases the **WeakNode**, ensuring the same address is not double-freed.

**Suggestions**
When using memory, consider whether the memory is double-freed or not freed. Additionally, when locating memory access crashes (usually **SIGSEGV** crashes), run the ASan to reproduce the fault if there is no clue based on the crash stack analysis.

#### Type 2: Multi-thread Crash

**Background**
**napi_env** is still used after being released.

**Symptom**
The **env** of a **napi** API is invalid. The crash stack is mounted to **NativeEngineInterface::ClearLastError()**. Based on the log of **env** address, it is found that the **env** is used after being released.

![cppcrash-demo9](figures/cppcrash_image_015.png)

The key crash stack is as follows.

![cppcrash-demo8](figures/cppcrash_image_014.png)

**Solutions**
The **env** created by a thread should not be transferred to another thread.

**Suggestions**
You can select the **Multi Thread Check** option to locate multi thread faults. For details, see "Ark Multi Thread Check" in guideline.

Note: **env** in the **napi** interface is the **arkNativeEngine** when the engine is created.

#### Type 3: Lifecycle Crash

**Background**
When you create a native **napi_value**, it needs to be used with **napi_handle_scope**. The **napi_handle_scope** is used to manage the lifecycle of **napi_value**. **napi_value** can be used only within **napi_handle_scope**, otherwise, the lifecycle of **napi_value** and its JS objects is no longer protected. If the reference count is 0, **napi_value** is collected by GC. Using **napi_value** at this point indicates accessing freed memory, which results in faults. 

**Symptom**
**napi_value** is a raw pointer (a struct pointer). It is used to hold JS objects and maintain the lifecycle of JS objects to ensure that JS objects are not collected by GC. **napi_handle_scope** is used to manage **napi_value**. Once out of **napi_handle_scope**, **napi_value** is collected by GC, and **napi_value** no longer holds the JS object (no longer protects the JS object's lifecycle)

**Fault Analysis**
By decompiling the crash stack, the upper-level interface of the problematic **napi** interface can be located, in which the problematic **napi_value** can be found. In this case, you need to check if the **napi_value** is used out of **napi_handle_scope**. 

**Cases**
The **napi_value** is used out of the scope of the NAPI framework.

![cppcrash-demo9](figures/cppcrash_image_016.png)

On the JS side, data is added using the **Add()**, and on the native side, **napi_value** is saved to a **vector**. On the JS side, data is obtained using the **get** API, and on the native side, the saved **napi_value** is returned as an array. The JS side then reads the properties of the data. The error message "Can not get Prototype on non ECMA Object" is displayed. The **native_value** across **napi** is not saved using **napi_ref**. As a result, the **native_value** is invalid.
Note: The scope of the NAPI framework is **napi_handle_scope**. You can use **napi_handle_scope** to manage the lifecycle of **napi_value**. The scope of the framework layer is embedded in the end-to-end process of the JS call native. That is, the scope is opened when the native method is entered, and the scope is closed when the native method ends.

#### Type 4: Pointer Crash

**Background**
Smart pointers are used without null checks, causing null pointer dereference crashes during process execution. 

**Impact**
The process crashes, causing unexpected exit.

**Fault Analysis**
![cppcrash-demo10](figures/cppcrash_image_017.png)

Null pointer crashes can be identified based on the fault cause. Run the llvm-addr2line command to parse the line number. It is found that the service code does not check whether the smart pointer is null before using it. As a result, the service code accesses the null address, causing the crash.

**Solution**
Add protective null checks for the pointer. 

**Suggestions**
Pointers should be null-checked before using it to prevent null pointers and process crashes and exits.

### Analyzing CppCrash Based on Tools

#### Tool 1: ASAN

[ASan Check](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-asan-V5)

#### Tool 2: Ark Multi Thread Check

**Fundamentals**
JS is single-threaded. Operations on JS objects can be performed only on the JS thread. Otherwise, multi-thread security problems may occur. (JS objects created on the main thread can be operated only on the main thread, and JS objects created on the worker thread can be operated only on the worker thread.) The napi APIs involve object operations. Therefore, 95% napi APIs can be used only on the JS thread. The multi-thread detection mechanism checks whether the **JS thread ID** of the calling thread is the same as that of the used **VM/Env**. If they are different, the **VM/Env** is used across threads, causing multi-thread security problems. Common problems: 1. Napi APIs are used in non-JS threads. 2. **env** of other threads are used in napi APIs.

**How to Use**
![cppcrash-demo13](figures/cppcrash_image_020.png)

Select **Multi Thread Check** on DevEco to enable Ark multi-thread detection.

**Scenario**
If the stack of crash logs is difficult to analyze and the probability of this problem is high, you need to enable multi-thread detection. When the multi-thread detection is enabled, if the fatal information in the **cpp_crash** log is "Fatal: ecma_vm cannot run in multi-thread! thread:3096 currentThread:3550", it indicates that a multi-thread security problem occurs. That is, the calling thread ID is **3550**, but the JS thread is created by thread **3096**. The **vm** is used across threads.

**Cases**
After the function is enabled, the crash is triggered again. If the problem is caused by multiple threads, fatal information is displayed. The following is an example:

```
Fatal: ecma_vm cannot run in multi-thread! thread:xxx currentThread:yyy
```

The preceding information indicates that the calling thread ID is **17585**, but the JS thread is created by thread **17688**. The **vm** is used across threads. The **vm** is the **napi_env__*** of the JS thread. It is the environment for running thread code. One thread uses one **vm**.
The key crash log is as follows:

```

```

To analyze the multi-thread problem, perform the following steps:
i. Check the first stack frame under **libace_napi.z.so**. The preceding figure shows **xxxxx.so**. Check whether the **napi_env** of thread **17688** is transferred to thread **17585**.
ii. If the stack frame under **libace_napi.z.so** does not transfer the **napi_env** parameter, check whether the parameter is transferred as a struct member variable.

#### Tool 3: objdump

**How to Use**
objdump binary is a system tool. You must have the OpenHarmony compilation environment, whose project code can be obtained from Gitee. The command is as follows:

```
repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b master --no-repo-verify --no-clone-bundle --depth=1
repo sync -c
./build/prebuilts_download.sh
```

You can obtain the tool in **prebuilts/clang/ohos/linux-x86_64/llvm/bin/llvm-objdump** of the project. The command is as follows:

```
prebuilts/clang/ohos/linux-x86_64/llvm/bin/llvm-objdump -d libark_jsruntime.so > dump.txt
```

**Scenario**
In some cases, addr2line can only be used to check whether a line of the code is faulty but cannot determine which variable is abnormal. In this case, you can use objdump to disassemble the code and combine the information from the cppcrash register to further determine the crash cause.

**Cases**
The log is as follows:

Run the addr2line command to locate the error line.

The preceding information indicates that a null pointer is accessed and the process is suspended when **InYoungSpace** is accessed. Therefore, it can be suspected that the **Region** is a null pointer.
Use objdump to disassemble and search for the error address **4492d4**. The command is as follows:

![cppcrash-demo15](figures/cppcrash_image_022.png)

Check the **x20** register, and the value is **0x000000000000000**. The preceding information shows that **x20** performs bitwise operation based on **x2** (the last 18 bits are cleared, which is a typical **Region::ObjectAddressToRange** operation). The analysis shows that **x2** is the second parameter object of the **MarkObject** function, and **x20** is the variable **objectRegion**.

**ldrb w8, [x20]** corresponds to **packedData_.flags_.spaceFlag_** because **packedData_** is the first field of **region**, **flags_** is the first field of **packedData_**, and **spaceFlag_** is the first field of **flags_**. Therefore, the first byte corresponding to the **objectRegion** address is used.
To view assembly code, you need to be familiar with common assembly instructions and parameter transfer rules. For example, the non-inline member function **r0** in C++ stores the **this** pointer. In addition, due to compiler optimization, the mapping between source code and assembly code may not be clear. The mapping can be quickly obtained based on some feature values (constants) in the code.
