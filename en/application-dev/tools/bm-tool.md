### 9568347 The Local .so File Fails to Be Parsed
**Error Message**

Error: install parse native so failed.

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or running a C++ app/service, the error message "error: install parse native so failed" is displayed during HAP installation.

**Possible Causes**

The Application Binary Interface (ABI) supported by the device does not match that configured in the C++ project.

> **NOTE**
>
> - If the project has a dependent HSP or HAR module, make sure that one of the ABI types configured for all modules that contain C++ code is supported by the device.
> - If the project depends on a third-party library that includes .so files, make sure the appropriate ABI directory for your device, such as **arm64-v8a** or **x86_64**, is present in the **oh_modules/*third-party-library*/libs** directory.
<!--RP1--><!--RP1End-->

**Solution**

1. Connect the device to DevEco Studio.
2. Open the CLI and go to the **toolchains** directory in the SDK installation directory.
    ```
    To check the OpenHarmony SDK installation directory, choose **File** > **Settings** > **SDK**.
    ```
3. Run the following command to obtain the list of ABI types supported by the device, which include one or more of the following: default, armeabi-v7a, armeabi, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64.
    ```
    hdc shell
    param get const.product.cpu.abilist
    ```
4. Based on the obtained list, modify the **abiFilters** settings in the [module-level build-profile.json5](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V13/ide-hvigor-compilation-options-customizing-sample-V13#section4322212200) file. The rules are as follows:
    * If the list includes only **default**, run the following command to check whether the **lib64** folder exists:
      ```
      cd /system/
      ls
      ```
      ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001609001262.png)
      * If the **lib64** folder exists, add the arm64-v8a type to **abiFilters**.
      * If the **lib64** folder does not exist, add armeabi, armeabi-v7a, or both types to **abiFilters**.
    * If the list includes one or more of the following, add at least one of them to **abiFilters**: armeabi-v7a, armeabi, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64.

### 9568344 The Configuration File Fails to Be Parsed
**Error Message**

Error: install parse profile prop check error.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585361412.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install parse profile prop check error" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

1. The **bundleName** in [app.json5 configuration file](../quick-start/app-configuration-file.md#tags-in-the-configuration-file) and the **name** in [module.json5 configuration file](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#tags-in-the-configuration-file) are invalid.

<!--Del-->
2. The **type** field in [extensionAbilities](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md#extensionabilities) is set to **service** or **dataShare**.
<!--DelEnd-->


**Solution**
1. Change the **bundleName** field in the **app.json5 configuration** file and the **name** field in the **module.json5 configuration** file based on the naming rules.
<!--Del-->
2. If the **type** field in **extensionAbilities** is set to **service** or **dataShare**, configure the [allowAppUsePrivilegeExtension privilege](../../device-dev/subsystems/subsys-app-privilege-config-guide.md) for the application as follows:

1. Obtain the new signature fingerprint.

    a. Obtain the storage path of the signature file, which is the value of **profile** in the **signingConfigs** field in the **project-level build-profile.json5** file.

    b. Open the signature file (with the file name extension .p7b), search for **development-certificate** in the file, copy **-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----**, **-----END CERTIFICATE-----**, and the information between them to a new text file, delete the newline characters, and save the file as a new .cer file.

    The format of the new .cer file is shown below. (The file content is an example.)

    ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585521364.png)

    c. Use the keytool (available in the **jbr/bin** folder of the DevEco Studio installation directory) to obtain the SHA-256 value of the certificate fingerprint from the .cer file:
      ```
      keytool -printcert -file xxx.cer
      ```
    d. Remove the colon (:\) from the SHA-256 content in the certificate fingerprint. What you get is the signature fingerprint.
    
    An example SHA-256 value is shown below.
    ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635921233.png)
    
    The signature fingerprint obtained by removing the colon is 5753DDBC1A8EF88A62058A9FC4B6AFAFC1C5D8D1A1B86FB3532739B625F8F3DB.

2. Obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device.

    a. Connect the device and enter the shell.
    ```
    hdc shell
    ```
    b. Run the following command to view the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device:
    ```
    // Obtain the path of the install list.
    find /system -name install_list_capability.json
    ```
    c. Run the following command to obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file:
    ```
        hdc target mount
    hdc file recv /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
    ```

3. Add the signature fingerprint obtained to **app_signature** in the **install_list_capability.json** file. Note that the signature fingerprint must be configured under the corresponding bundle name.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635641893.png)
4. Push the modified **install_list_capability.json** file to the device and restart the device.

    ```
        hdc target mount
    hdc file send install_list_capability.json /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
    hdc shell chmod 644 /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
    hdc shell reboot
    ```
5. Reinstall the application.<!--DelEnd-->

* 1. Check and add mandatory fields by referring to the [app.json5 file](../quick-start/app-configuration-file.md) and [module.json5 file](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md).
* 2. Determine the missing fields based on the HiLog.

    Run the following command to enable disk flushing:
    ```
    hilog -w start
    ```

    Disk location: **/data/log/hilog**

    Open the log file and find **profile prop %{public}s is mission**. For example, **profile prop icon is mission** indicates that the **icon** field is missing.


### 9568258 The Release Types of the New Application and Existing Application Are Different
**Error Message**

Error: install releaseType target not same.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001609976041.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install releaseType target not same" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: The value of **releaseType** in the SDK used by the existing HAP is different from that used by the new HAP.
* Scenario 2: When the application has multiple HAPs, the **releaseType** values in the SDK used by each HAP are different.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Uninstall the existing HAP on the device and then install a new HAP.
* Scenario 2: Use the same SDK to repackage the HAPs to ensure that the **releaseType** values of multiple HAPs are the same.


### 9568322 The Signature Verification Fails Because the Application Source Is Untrusted
**Error Message**

Error: signature verification failed due to not trusted app source.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585042216.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: signature verification failed due to not trusted app source" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: The signature does not contain the UDID of the debugging device.

* Scenario 2: The [release certificate and release profile](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-releaseharmony-0000001933963166) is used during signature. However, an application signed by a release certificate cannot be debugged or run.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1:
	1. Use [automatic signing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V13/ide-signing-V13#section18815157237) to sign the HAP file. after the device is connected.
	2. If manual signature is used, add the UDID of the device to the **UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json** file. For details, see <!--RP2-->[hapsigner Guide](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/security/hapsigntool-guidelines.md)<!--RP2End-->.

        1. Obtain the UDID of the device.

        ```
          // Command for obtaining the UDID
          hdc shell bm get -u
        ```

        2. Go to the DevEco Studio installation path and open the **UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json** configuration file in the SDK directory.

        ```
          DevEco Studio installation path\sdk\version number or default\openharmony\toolchains\lib\

          Example: xxxx\Huawei\DevEco Studio\sdk\HarmonyOS-NEXT-DB1\openharmony\toolchains\lib\
          Example: xxxx\Huawei\DevEco Studio\sdk\default\openharmony\toolchains\lib\
        ```

        3. Add the UDID of the device to the **device-ids** field in the **UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json** file.

* Scenario 2: Use the [debug certificate and debug profile](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-debug-app-0000001914423098) to re-sign the application.


### 9568289 The Installation Fails Because the Permission Request Fails
**Error Message**

**Error Message**

Error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635521909.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The SDK version used for build and packing does not match the device image version.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: The device image version is earlier than the SDK version for build and packing. Update the device image version. Run the following command to query the device image version:
  ```
  hdc shell param get const.ohos.apiversion
  ```
  If the API version provided by the image is 10 and the SDK version used for application build is also 10, the possible cause is that the image version is too early to be compatible with the SDK verification rules of the new version. In this case, update the image version to the latest version.

* Scenario 2: For applications that need to run on OpenHarmony devices, ensure that runtimeOS has been changed to OpenHarmony.

### 9568332 The Installation Fails Due to Inconsistent Signatures
**Error Message**

Error: install sign info inconsistent.

![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635761329.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install sign info inconsistent" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

1. The signatures of the existing application and new application are different, or the signatures of HAPs and HSPs are different. **Keep Application Data** is selected in **Edit Configurations** (the application installation is overwritten) and the application is re-signed.
2. If an application is uninstalled but its data is kept, and a new application with the same bundle name is later installed, it is necessary to check whether the identity details match. If the signature information is inconsistent, this error is reported.


**Solution**

1. Uninstall the application, or deselect **Keep Application Data**. Then install the new application.
2. If the signature inconsistency is caused by HSPs provided by different teams, use [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md). If there are multiple HAPs, ensure that their signatures are the same.
3. If an application is uninstalled but its data is kept, a new application with the same bundle name but different signature information fails to be installed. To install the new application, you must first reinstall the uninstalled application and uninstall it without retaining the data.

### 9568329 The Signature Information Fails to Be Verified
**Error Message**

Error: verify signature failed.

![Example](figures/en_image_155401.png)

**Symptom**

The **bundleName** in the signature information is different from that of the application.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: An HSP module provided by a third party is imported, and the HSP is neither an [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md) nor an HSP with the same bundle name, causing the bundle name inconsistency.

* Scenario 2: An incorrect signature file (with the file name extension .p7b) is used for signature, causing the bundle name inconsistency.


**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Use an HSP only for the application with the same bundle name; use an integrated HSP for applications with different bundle names. Ask the third party to provide an integrated HSP or an HSP with the same bundle name.

* Scenario 2: Check the signing process and signing certificate. For details, see [Signing Your App/Atomic Service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V13/ide-signing-V13).


### 9568266 The Installation Permission Is Denied
**Error Message**

Error: install permission denied.

**Symptom**

When you run the **hdc install** command to install the HAP file, the error message "code:9568266 error: install permission denied" is displayed.

**Possible Causes**

The **hdc install** command cannot be used to install the enterprise application with a release signature.

**Solution**

1. Run the **hdc install** command to install and debug the enterprise application with a debug signature.


### 9568337 The Installation Parsing Fails
**Error Message**

Error: install parse unexpected.

**Symptom**

When an application is pushed to a device, an error message is displayed, indicating that the HAP file fails to be opened.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: The storage space of the system partition is full. As a result, when you run the **hdc file send** command, files on the device are damaged due to insufficient storage space.

* Scenario 2: The HAP file is damaged when it is pushed to the device.

**Solution**

* 1. Check the storage space allocated to the system partition. If the storage space is full, clear the storage space to install the HAP file.
  ```bash
  hdc shell df -h /system
  ```

* 2. Check the MD5 values of the local HAP file and the HAP file pushed to the device. If they are different, the HAP is damaged during the push. In this case, push the file again.
