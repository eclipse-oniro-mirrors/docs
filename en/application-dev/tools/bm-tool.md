## Error Codes

### 9568320 The signature file does not exist
**Error Message**

Failed to install bundle, no signature file.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001389116960.png)

**Symptom**

A user attempts to install an unsigned HAP file.

**Possible Causes**

The HAP file is not signed.

**Solution**

1. Use [automatic signing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-signing-V5#section18815157237) to sign the HAP file after the device is connected.
2. Manually sign the HAP file. For details, see [Signing Your App/Service Manually](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-signing-V5#section297715173233).
<br></br>

### 9568347 The local .so file fails to be parsed
**Error Message**

Error: install parse native so failed.

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or running a C++ app/service, the error message "error: install parse native so failed" is displayed during HAP installation.

**Possible Causes**

The Application Binary Interface (ABI) supported by the device does not match that configured in the C++ project.

**Solution**

1. Connect the device to DevEco Studio.
2. Open the command line tool and go to the **toolchains\{*Version*}** directory in the OpenHarmony SDK installation directory.
    ```
    To check the OpenHarmony SDK installation directory, choose **File** > **Settings** > **SDK**.
    ```
3. Run the following command to obtain the list of ABI types supported by the device, which include one or more of the following: default, armeabi-v7a, armeabi, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64.
    ```
    hdc shell
    param get const.product.cpu.abilist
    ```
4. Based on the obtained list, modify the **abiFilters** settings in the [module-level build-profile.json5](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-hvigor-compilation-options-customizing-sample-V5#section4322212200) file. The rules are as follows:
    * If the list includes only **default**, run the following command to check whether the **lib64** folder exists:
      ```
      cd /system/
      ls
      ```
      ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001609001262.png)
      * If the **lib64** folder exists, add the arm64-v8a type to **abiFilters**.
      * If the **lib64** folder does not exist, add armeabi, armeabi-v7a, or both types to **abiFilters**.
    * If the list includes one or more of the following, add at least one of them to **abiFilters**: armeabi-v7a, armeabi, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64.

### 9568344 The configuration file fails to be parsed
**Error Message**

Error: install parse profile prop check error.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585361412.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install parse profile prop check error" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The application uses the privileges, but the new signature fingerprint is not added to the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device after the signature file of the application is changed.

**Solution**

1. Obtain the new signature fingerprint.

    a. Obtain the storage path of the signature file, which is the value of **profile** in the **signingConfigs** field in the [project-level build-profile.json5](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-hvigor-compilation-options-customizing-sample-V5#section1448071082016) file.

    b. Open the signature file (with the file name extension .p7b), search for **development-certificate** in the file, copy **-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----**, **-----END CERTIFICATE-----**, and the information between them to a new text file, delete the newline characters, and save the file as a new .cer file.

    The format of the new .cer file is shown below. (The file content is an example.)

    ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585521364.png)



    c. Use the keytool (available in the **jbr/bin** folder of the DevEco Studio installation directory) to obtain the SHA-256 value of the certificate fingerprint from the .cer file:
      ```
      keytool -printcert -file xxx.cer
      ```
    d. Remove the colon (:) from the SHA-256 content in the certificate fingerprint. What you get is the signature fingerprint.
    
    An example SHA-256 value is shown below.
    ![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635921233.png)

    The signature fingerprint obtained by removing the colon is 5753DDBC1A8EF88A62058A9FC4B6AFAFC1C5D8D1A1B86FB3532739B625F8F3DB.

2. Obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device.

    a. Connect the device.

    b. Run the following command to view the **install_list_capability.json** file of the device:
    ```
    find /system -name install_list_capability.json
    ```
    The **install_list_capability.json** file of the device is stored in the following directory. Find the corresponding configuration file based on the bundle name.
    ```
    /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
    ```
    c. Run the following command to obtain the **install_list_capability.json** file:
    ```
    hdc shell mount -o rw,remount /
    hdc file recv /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json
    ```

3. Add the signature fingerprint obtained to **app_signature** in the **install_list_capability.json** file. Note that the signature fingerprint must be configured under the corresponding bundle name.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635641893.png)
4. Push the modified **install_list_capability.json** file to the device and restart the device.

    ```
    hdc shell mount -o rw,remount / 
    hdc file send install_list_capability.json /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json 
    hdc shell chmod 644 /system/etc/app/install_list_capability.json 
    hdc shell reboot
    ```
5. Reinstall the application.


### 9568305 The dependent module does not exist
**Error Message**

Error: dependent module does not exist.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001560338986.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: dependent module does not exist" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The SharedLibrary module on which the application depends is not installed.

**Solution**

1. Install the dependent SharedLibrary module. On the **Run/Debug Configurations** page of DevEco Studio, select **Keep Application Data** on the **General** tab page, and click **OK** to save the configuration. Then run or debug the application again.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001560201786.png)
2. On the **Run/Debug Configurations** page of DevEco Studio, click the **Deploy Multi Hap** tab, select **Deploy Multi Hap Packages**, select the dependent module SharedLibrary, and click **OK** to save the configuration. Then run or debug the application again.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001610761941.png)


### 9568259 Some fields are missing in the configuration file
**Error Message**

Error: install parse profile missing prop.<br>
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001559130596.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install parse profile missing prop" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

Mandatory fields are missing in the **app.json5** and **module.json5** files.

**Solution**

* 1. Check and add mandatory fields by referring to the [app.json5 file](../quick-start/app-configuration-file.md) and [module.json5 file](../quick-start/module-configuration-file.md).
* 2. Determine the missing fields based on the HiLog.

    Run the following command to enable disk flushing:
    ```
    hilog -w start
    ```

    Disk location: /data/log/hilog

    Open the log file and find **profile prop %{public}s is mission**. For example, **profile prop icon is mission** indicates that the **icon** field is missing.


### 9568258 The release types of the new application and existing application are different
**Error Message**

Error: install releaseType target not same.<br>
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001609976041.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install releaseType target not same" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The value of **releaseType** in the SDK used by the existing HAP is different from that used by the new HAP.

**Solution**

1. Uninstall the existing HAP on the device, and then install the new HAP.


### 9568322 The signature verification fails because the application source is untrusted
**Error Message**

Error: signature verification failed due to not trusted app source.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585042216.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: signature verification failed due to not trusted app source" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: The signature does not contain the UDID of the debugging device.

* Scenario 2: The [release certificate and release profile](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-releaseharmony-0000001933963166) is used during signature. However, an application signed by a release certificate cannot be debugged or run.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1:
	1. Use [automatic signing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-signing-V5#section18815157237) to sign the HAP file after the device is connected.
	2. If manual signature is used, add the UDID of the device to the **UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json** file. For details, see <!--RP2-->[hapsigner Guide](../security/hapsigntool-guidelines.md)<!--RP2End-->.
		```
		// Command for obtaining the UDID
		hdc shell bm get -u
		```
* Scenario 2: Use the [debug certificate and debug profile](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-debug-app-0000001914423098) to re-sign the application.


### 9568289 The installation fails because the permission request fails
**Error Message**

Error: install failed due to grant request permissions failed.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001585201996.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install failed due to grant request permissions failed" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The application uses the default Ability Privilege Level (APL), which is normal, and requires the system_basic or system_core permission.

**Solution**

1. Change the APL in the **UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json** file to **system_basic** or **system_core**, and sign and pack the application again.


### 9568297 The installation fails because the SDK version of the device is too early
**Error Message**

Error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635521909.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install failed due to older sdk version in the device" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The SDK version used for build and packing does not match the device image version.

**Solution**

* Scenario 1: The device image version is earlier than the SDK version for build and packing. Update the device image version. Run the following command to query the device image version:
  ```
  hdc shell param get const.ohos.apiversion
  ```
  If the API version provided by the image is 10 and the SDK version used for application build is also 10, the possible cause is that the image version is too early to be compatible with the SDK verification rules of the new version. In this case, update the image version to the latest version.

* Scenario 2: For applications that need to run on OpenHarmony devices, ensure that runtimeOS has been changed to OpenHarmony.


### 9568332 The installation fails due to inconsistent signatures
**Error Message**

Error: install sign info inconsistent.
![Example](figures/en-us_image_0000001635761329.png)

**Symptom**

When you start debugging or run an application, the error message "error: install sign info inconsistent" is displayed during the installation of the HAP.

**Possible Causes**

The signatures of the existing application and new application are different, or the signatures of HAPs and HSPs are different. **Keep Application Data** is selected in **Edit Configurations** (the application installation is overwritten) and the application is re-signed.


**Solution**
zh-cn\application-dev\quick-start\integrated-hsp.md
1. Uninstall the application, or deselect **Keep Application Data**. Then install the new application.
2. If the signature inconsistency is caused by HSPs provided by different teams, use [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md). If there are multiple HAPs, ensure that their signatures are the same.

### 9568329 The signature information fails to be verified
**Error Message**

Error: verify signature failed.

![Example](figures/en_image_155401.png)

**Symptom**

The **bundleName** in the signature information is different from that of the application.

**Possible Causes**

* Scenario 1: An HSP module provided by a third party is imported, and the HSP is neither an [integrated HSP](../quick-start/integrated-hsp.md) nor an HSP with the same bundle name, causing the bundle name inconsistency.

* Scenario 2: An incorrect signature file (with the file name extension .p7b) is used for signature, causing the bundle name inconsistency.


**Solution**

* Scenario 1: Use an HSP only for the application with the same bundle name; use an integrated HSP for applications with different bundle names. Ask the third party to provide an integrated HSP or an HSP with the same bundle name.

* Scenario 2: Check the signing process and signing certificate. For details, see [Signing Your App/Service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/ide-signing-V5).

* Scenario 1: The storage space of the system partition is full. As a result, when you run the **hdc file send** command, files on the device are damaged due to insufficient storage space.

* Scenario 2: The HAP file is damaged when it is pushed to the device.

**Solution**

* 1. Check the storage space allocated to the system partition. If the storage space is full, clear the storage space to install the HAP file.
  ```bash
  hdc shell df -h /system
  ```

* 2. Check the MD5 values of the local HAP file and the HAP file pushed to the device. If they are different, the HAP is damaged during the push. In this case, push the file again.
