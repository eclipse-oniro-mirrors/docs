# Using System Pickers

A Picker is implemented by an independent system process. It provides a safe, built-in way for users to grant your application access to only selected resources. By starting a Picker component, the application can directly access the resources, such as images or documents, selected by the user using the Picker.

For example, an audio player can obtain the path of the audio file selected by the user via **AudioViewPicker**, and play the audio clip.

Currently, the following Picker components are available:

- [AudioViewPicker](#audioviewpicker): allows to select or save audio files.

- [DocumentViewPicker](#documentviewpicker): allows to select or save documents.

- [PhotoViewPicker](#photoviewpicker): allows to select or save images or videos.

- [Contacts Picker](#contacts-picker): allows to select a contact.

- [Camera Picker](#camera-picker): allows the camera to be used to take photos and record videos.
