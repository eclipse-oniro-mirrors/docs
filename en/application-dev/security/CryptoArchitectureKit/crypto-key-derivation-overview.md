# Key Derivation Overview and Algorithm Specifications

A key derivation function (KDF) is a cryptographic algorithm that derives one or more secret keys from a secret value by using a pseudorandom function (PRF). It can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys in the required format.

## PBKDF2

Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) is a key derivation function with a sliding computational cost. PBKDF2 is part of the PKCS series.

PBKDF2 applies a PRF, such as an [HMAC](crypto-compute-hmac.md), to an input password together with a salt value, and repeats the process multiple times to generate a derived key.

When creating a **KDF** instance, you need to specify the algorithm specifications in a string parameter. The string parameter consists of the KDF algorithm and HMAC algorithm with a vertical bar (|) in between.
| KDF Algorithm| HMAC Algorithm| String Parameter| API Version|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| PBKDF2 | SHA1 | PBKDF2\|SHA1 | 11+ |
| PBKDF2 | SHA224 | PBKDF2\|SHA224 | 11+ |
| PBKDF2 | SHA256 | PBKDF2\|SHA256 | 11+ |
| PBKDF2 | SHA384 | PBKDF2\|SHA384 | 11+ |
| PBKDF2 | SHA512 | PBKDF2\|SHA512 | 11+ |
| PBKDF2 | SM3 | PBKDF2\|SM3 | 11+ |

## HKDF

HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is a simple KDF based on an [HMAC](crypto-compute-hmac.md). It is used to expand limited input key material into a cryptographically strong secret key.

The HKDF has three modes:

- **EXTRACT_ONLY**: generates a pseudorandom key (PRK) from the input key material (IKM) and an optional salt.
- **EXPAND_ONLY**: expands the PRK to a key of the specified length.
- **EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND**: generates a PRK from the IKM and salt, and expands it to a key of the specified length. 

When creating a **KDF** instance, you need to specify the algorithm specifications in a string parameter. The string parameter consists of the KDF algorithm, HMAC algorithm, and mode with a vertical bar (|) in between.
| KDF Algorithm| HMAC Algorithm| Mode| String Parameter| API Version|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| HKDF | SHA1 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SHA1 | 12+ |
| HKDF | SHA224 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SHA224 | 12+ |
| HKDF | SHA256 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SHA256 | 12+ |
| HKDF | SHA384 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SHA384 | 12+ |
| HKDF | SHA512 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SHA512 | 12+ |
| HKDF | SM3 | [EXPAND_ONLY\|EXTRACT_ONLY\|EXTRACT_AND_EXPAND] | HKDF\|SM3 | 12+ |

## Scrypt

Scrypt is a KDF used to produce a key from a password and a salt value. It has three main parameters:

- **n**: number of iterations.
- **r**: block size.
- **p**: parallelization. 

By adjusting these parameters, you can optimize the system based on different security requirements and hardware performance.
Using scrypt to derive keys consumes memory and computing resources. You must pass in appropriate values based on the device hardware conditions. You can use the following formula to calculate the memory:

Memory (in bytes) = p * 128 * r + 32 * r * (n + 2) * 4
