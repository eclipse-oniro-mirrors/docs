# Asymmetric Key Generation and Conversion Specifications


This topic describes the supported algorithms and specifications for asymmetric key generation and conversion. The specifications for key generation can be specified via either of the following:


- String parameter: presents the specifications of the key to generate in the form of a string.

- Key parameter: constructs the detailed cryptographic information of the key to generate in an object.


For details, see the specifications of each algorithm.

## RSA

Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. An RSA key can be generated based on a string parameter or key parameters.

### String Parameter

When creating an asymmetric key generator instance, you need to specify the key specifications in a string parameter. The string parameter consists of the RSA key type and prime count with a vertical bar (|) in between.

> **NOTE**
>
> When an RSA asymmetric key is generated, the default number of primes is 2 and the **PRIMES_2** parameter can be omitted.

| RSA Key Type| Prime Count| String Parameter| API Version|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| RSA512 | 2 | RSA512\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA768 | 2 | RSA768\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA1024 | 2 | RSA1024\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA1024 | 3 | RSA1024\|PRIMES_3 | 9+ |
| RSA2048 | 2 | RSA2048\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA2048 | 3 | RSA2048\|PRIMES_3 | 9+ |
| RSA3072 | 2 | RSA3072\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA3072 | 3 | RSA3072\|PRIMES_3 | 9+ |
| RSA4096 | 2 | RSA4096\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA4096 | 3 | RSA4096\|PRIMES_3 | 9+ |
| RSA4096 | 4 | RSA4096\|PRIMES_4 | 9+ |
| RSA8192 | 2 | RSA8192\|PRIMES_2 | 9+ |
| RSA8192 | 3 | RSA8192\|PRIMES_3 | 9+ |
| RSA8192 | 4 | RSA8192\|PRIMES_4 | 9+ |
| RSA8192 | 5 | RSA8192\|PRIMES_5 | 9+ |

If it is used to convert keys, the specifications of the RSA keys generated are the same as the key specifications set in key conversion parameters.

### Key Parameter

Since API version 10, key parameters can be used to generate an RSA key.

The RSA key includes the following integers:

- **n**: modulus for both the private and public keys.

- **sk**: private exponent, which is often written as **d** in the formula.

- **pk**: public exponent, which is often written as **e** in the formula.

The following table illustrates the composition of the RSA key parameters.

- √ indicates the property used to construct a key parameter.

- x indicates that the property that cannot be used to construct a key parameter.

|  | Common Parameter| Public Key Parameter| Private Key Parameter| Key Pair Parameter|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| n | × | √ | × | √ |
| pk | N/A | √ | N/A | √ |
| sk | N/A | N/A | × | √ |

According to the preceding table:

- The RSA key cannot be generated based on the common parameter (**n**).

- The RSA private key cannot be generated based on the private key parameter, which consists of **n** and **sk**.


## ECC

Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is a public-key encryption algorithm based on elliptic curve mathematics.

The ECC algorithm can be regarded as an operation of numbers defined in a special set. Currently, the Crypto framework supports only elliptic curves in the **Fp** field for ECC keys, where **p** indicates a prime. The **Fp** field is also called prime field.

An ECC key can be generated based on a string parameter or key parameters, and the common parameter can be generated based on the curve name.


### String Parameter

> **NOTE**
>
> If the created ECC asymmetric key generator is used to randomly generate keys, the specifications of the ECC keys generated are the same as the key specifications set when the key generator is created. If it is used to convert keys, the specifications of the ECC keys generated are the same as the key specifications set in key conversion parameters.

The ECC key in the **Fp** field includes the following properties:

- **p**: prime used to determine **Fp**.

- **a**, **b**: determine the elliptic curve equation.

- **g**: base point of the elliptic curve, which can be represented as **gx** or **gy**.

## DSA

Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a public-key algorithm based on the modular exponentiation and discrete logarithm problem. It is used for digital signatures and signature verification, but not for encryption and decryption.

A DSA key can be generated based on a string parameter or key parameters.

### Constraints

It takes time to generate a DSA2048 or DSA3072 asymmetric key pair or when the plaintext length exceeds 2048 bits.

Since the execution of the main thread has a time limit, the operation may fail if you use a synchronous API. You are advised to use asynchronous APIs or use [multithread concurrent tasks](../../arkts-utils/multi-thread-concurrency-overview.md) to generate a key of a large size.

### String Parameter

When creating an asymmetric key generator instance, you need to specify the key specifications in a string parameter. The string parameter consists of the asymmetric key algorithm and key length.

> **NOTE**
>
> If the created DH asymmetric key generator is used to randomly generate keys, the specifications of the DH keys generated are the same as the key specifications set when the key generator is created. If it is used to convert keys, the specifications of the DH keys generated are the same as the key specifications set in key conversion parameters.

### Key Parameter

Since API version 11, key parameters can be used to generate a DH key.

The DH key includes the following properties:

- **p**: a large prime used as a modulus of a finite field. It is shared by all communicating parties.

- **g**: a primitive root modulo **p**. It is shared by all communicating parties.

- **l**: length of the private key, in bits. The value **0** means the length of the private key is not specified.

- **sk**: private key, which is a randomly generated value.

- **pk**: public key, which is calculated using the common parameter (**p** and **g**) and the private key.

The following table illustrates the composition of the DH key parameters.

- √ indicates the property used to construct a key parameter.

|  | Common Parameter| Public Key Parameter| Private Key Parameter| Key Pair Parameter|

| l | √ | √ | √ | √ |
| pk | N/A | √ | N/A | √ |
| sk | N/A | N/A | √ | √ |


### Common Parameter Generated Based on the Prime Length and Private Key Length

Since API version 11, the DH common parameter can be generated based on the prime length and private key length.

If the prime length is the same as that of the DH group, the DH group is used. The following table lists the mappings between the prime lengths and DH groups.

| Prime Length (Bit)| Named DH Group|
| -------- | -------- |
| 2048 | ffdhe2048 |
| 3072 | ffdhe3072 |
| 4096 | ffdhe4096 |
| 6144 | ffdhe6144 |
| 8192 | ffdhe8192 |

- The number of bits for **p** must be greater than or equal to 512 and less than or equal to 10000.

- The parameter **l** (private key length) is optional. The default value is **0**. The value of **l** must meet the following requirements:<br>**l** > 2 \* (96 + (Length of p – 1)/1024 x 16)

- The generated common parameter can be used to randomly generate public and private keys, or used to construct the public key parameter, private key parameter, or key pair parameter.

- Named DH groups are recommended because generating a key parameter with an unnamed DH group is time-consuming.
