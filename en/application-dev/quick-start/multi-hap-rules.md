# Multi-HAP Usage Rules


- The App Pack cannot be directly installed on a device. It is only used as a form of application to be released to the application market.

- All HAP files in the App Pack must share the same **bundleName** value in the configuration files.

- All HAP files in the App Pack must share the same **versionCode** value in the configuration files.

- In an App Pack, each type of device supports only one HAP file of the entry type but zero, one, or more HAP files of the feature type.

- Each HAP file in the App Pack must have **moduleName** configured. Among HAP files of the same device type, the **moduleName** value must be unique.

- The signing certificates of all HAP files in the same application must be the same. Applications are released to the application market in the form of App Pack after being signed. Before distribution, the application market splits an App Pack into HAP files and resigns them to ensure the consistency of HAP file signing certificates. Before installing HAP files on a device through the CLI or DevEco Studio for debugging, ensure that their signing certificates are the same. Otherwise, the installation will fail.
