# Overview of Other State Management Features


In addition to the component state and application state management mentioned in previous topics, ArkTS also provides \@Watch and $$ for state management.


- [\@Watch](arkts-watch.md) is used to listen for the changes of state variables.

- [$$operator](arkts-two-way-sync.md) provides a TS variable by-reference to a built-in component so that the variable value and the internal state of that component are kept in sync.
