| Default device| default | Device that provides full access to system capabilities.|
<!--RP2End-->

Example of the **deviceTypes** structure:


```json
{
  "module": {
    "name": "myHapName",
    "type": "feature",
    "deviceTypes" : [
       "tablet"
    ]
  }
}
```


## pages

The **pages** tag is a profile that represents information about specified pages.


```json
{
  "module": {
    // ...
    "pages": "$profile:main_pages", // Configured through the resource file in the profile
  }
}
```

Define the **main_pages.json** file under **resources/base/profile** in the development view. The file name (**main_pages** in this example) can be customized, but must be consistent with the information specified by the **pages** tag. The file lists the page information of the current application, including the route information and the window-related configuration.

  **Table 3** pages

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| src | Route information about all pages in the module, including the page path and page name. The page path is relative to the **src/main/ets** directory of the current module. The value is a string array, each element of which represents a page.| String array| No|

  "src": [
    "pages/index/mainPage",
    "pages/second/payment",
    "pages/third/shopping_cart",
    "pages/four/owner"
  ],
  "window": {
    "designWidth": 720,
    "autoDesignWidth": false
  }
}
```


## metadata

The **metadata** tag represents the custom metadata of the HAP. The tag value is an array and contains three subtags: **name**, **value**, and **resource**.

**Table 5** metadata

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| name | Name of the data item. The value is a string with a maximum of 255 bytes.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| value | Value of the data item. The value is a string with a maximum of 255 bytes.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| resource | Custom data format. The value is a resource index. It contains a maximum of 255 bytes.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|

The **metadata** tag can be used to configure the default size and position (in vp) of the main window in the format of alignment mode +/- offset. The name **ohos.ability.window.height** indicates the default height, **ohos.ability.window.width** indicates the default width, and **ohos.ability.window.left** indicates the default left position,|with alignment modes including **center**, **left** (default), and **right**. If the offset is **0**, this parameter can be omitted. The name **ohos.ability.window.top** indicates the position of the top, with alignment modes including **center**, **top** (default), and **bottom**. If both **weight** and **height** are omitted, the system default size is used.

The **metadata** tag can be used to configure the enabling function of removing the startup page. The name **enable.remove.starting.window** can be set to **true** or **false**. If the value is left empty, the default value **false** is used.

The value of **resource** is in the format of $profile:file name, where **\$profile** indicates that the resource is placed under **/resources/base/profile** in the project directory. For example, **\$profile:shortcuts_config** indicates the **/resources/base/profile/shortcuts_config.json** file.

```json
{
  "module": {
    "metadata": [{
      "name": "module_metadata",
      "value": "a test demo for module metadata",
      "resource": "$profile:shortcuts_config"

}
```

## shortcuts

The **shortcuts** tag provides the shortcut information of an application. The value is an array and consists of four sub-attributes: **shortcutId**, **label**, **icon**, and **wants**.

The **shortcut** information is identified in **metadata**, where:

- **name** indicates the name of the shortcut, identified by **ohos.ability.shortcuts**.

- **resource** indicates where the resources of the shortcut are stored.

**Table 11** shortcuts

| Name| Description| Data Type | Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| shortcutId | ID of the shortcut. The value is a string with a maximum of 63 bytes. **This field cannot be configured using the resource index ($string).**| String| No|

1. Configure the **shortcuts_config.json** file in **/resources/base/profile/**.

   ```json
   {
     "shortcuts": [
       {
         "shortcutId": "id_test1",
         "label": "$string:shortcut",
         "icon": "$media:aa_icon",
         "wants": [
           {

             "parameters": {
               "testKey": "testValue"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. In the **abilities** tag of the **module.json5** file, configure the **metadata** tag for the UIAbility component to which a shortcut needs to be added so that the shortcut configuration file takes effect for the UIAbility.

   ```json
   {
     "module": {
       // ...
       "abilities": [
         {
           "name": "EntryAbility",
           "srcEntry": "./ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ets",
           // ...
           "skills": [
             {
               "entities": [
                 "entity.system.home"
               ],
               "actions": [
                 "ohos.want.action.home"
               ]
             }
           ],
           "metadata": [
             {
               "name": "ohos.ability.shortcuts",
               "resource": "$profile:shortcuts_config"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
### wants

**Table 11-1** wants

| Name| Description| Data Type | Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| bundleName | Target bundle name of the shortcut.| String| No|
| moduleName | Target module name of the shortcut.| String| Yes|
| abilityName| Target ability name of the shortcut.| String| No|

      "abilityName": "EntryAbility",
      "parameters": {
        "testKey": "testValue"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## distributionFilter

The **distributionFilter** tag defines the rules for distributing HAP files based on different device specifications, so that precise matching can be performed when the application market distributes applications.

> **NOTE**
> This tag is supported since API version 10. In earlier versions, the **distroFilter** tag is used.

- **Application scenario**: If a project has multiple entry-type modules and the values of **deviceType** configured for these modules overlap, you need to use this tag to distinguish the modules. In the following example, both entry-type modules support the tablet type, and therefore the **distributionFilter** tag is required.
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry1
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry1",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "tv",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry2
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry2",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "car",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

- **Configuration rules**: This tag consists of four attributes: [screenShape](#screenshape), [screenWindow](#screenwindow), [screenDensity](#screendensity), and [countryCode](#countrycode).

  During distribution, a unique HAP is determined based on the mapping between **deviceTypes** and the preceding attributes.

  * When configuring this tag, include at least one of the attributes.
  * If any one or more attributes are set for one entry-type module, the same attributes must be set for all other entry-type modules.
  * The **screenShape** and **screenWindow** attributes are available only for lite wearables.

- **Configuration**: This tag must be configured in the **/resources/base/profile** directory and be referenced in the **resource** field of **metadata**.

          "menuKind": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Behavior**

After a context menu is registered, the **More** option of the menu, when clicked, displays a sublist of menu items specified in **menuItem**.
