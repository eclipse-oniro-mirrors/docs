**Table 10** requestPermissions

| Name| Description| Data Type| Value Range| Default Value|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| name | Name of the permission to request. This attribute is mandatory.| String| Custom| –|
| reason | Reason for requesting the permission. This attribute is mandatory when the permission to request is **user_grant**.<br>**NOTE**<br>If the permission to request is **user_grant**, this attribute is required for the application to be released to the application market.

Example of the **requestPermissions** structure:


```json
{
  "module" : {
    "requestPermissions": [
      {
        "name": "ohos.abilitydemo.permission.PROVIDER",
        "reason": "$string:reason",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "EntryFormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


## shortcuts

The **shortcuts** tag provides the shortcut information of an application. The value is an array of up to four shortcuts. It consists of four sub-attributes: **shortcutId**, **label**, **icon**, and **wants**.

The **shortcut** information is identified in **metadata**, where:

- **name** indicates the name of the shortcut, identified by **ohos.ability.shortcuts**.

- **resource** indicates where the resources of the shortcut are stored.

**Table 11** shortcuts

| Name| Description| Data Type | Default Value|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| shortcutId | ID of the shortcut. The value is a string with a maximum of 63 bytes.| String| No|
| label | Label of the shortcut, that is, the text description displayed for the shortcut. The value is a string with a maximum of 255 bytes. It can be descriptive content or a resource index.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| icon | Icon of the shortcut. The value is the index to the icon resource file.| String| Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| [wants](../application-models/want-overview.md) | Wants to which the shortcut points. Each want can contain one or more of the **bundleName**, **moduleName**, and **abilityName** sub-attributes.<br>- **bundleName**: target bundle name of the shortcut. The value is a string.<br>- **moduleName**: the target module name of the shortcut. The value is a string.<br>- **abilityName**: target component name of the shortcut. The value is a string.| Object| Yes (initial value: left empty)|


1. Configure the **shortcuts_config.json** file in **/resource/base/profile/**.

   ```json
   {
     "shortcuts": [
       {
         "shortcutId": "id_test1",
         "label": "$string:shortcut",
         "icon": "$media:aa_icon",
         "wants": [
           {
             "bundleName": "com.ohos.hello",
             "moduleName": "entry",
             "abilityName": "EntryAbility"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. In the **abilities** tag of the **module.json5** file, configure the **metadata** tag for the UIAbility component to which a shortcut needs to be added so that the shortcut configuration file takes effect for the UIAbility.

   ```json
   {
     "module": {
       // ...
       "abilities": [
         {
           "name": "EntryAbility",
           "srcEntry": "./ets/entryability/EntryAbility.ts",
           // ...
           "skills": [
             {
               "entities": [
                 "entity.system.home"
               ],
               "actions": [
                 "ohos.want.action.home"
               ]
             }
           ],
           "metadata": [
             {
               "name": "ohos.ability.shortcuts",
               "resource": "$profile:shortcuts_config"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```


## distroFilter

The **distributionFilter** tag defines the rules for distributing HAP files based on different device specifications, so that precise matching can be performed when the application market distributes applications.

- **Application scenario**:
  
  If a project has multiple entry-type modules and the values of **deviceType** configured for these modules overlap, you need to use this tag to distinguish the modules. In the following example, both entry-type modules support the tablet type, and therefore the **distributionFilter** tag is required.
  
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry1
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry1",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "tv",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```json
  // Device types supported by entry2
  {
    "module": {
      "name": "entry2",
      "type": "entry",
      "deviceTypes" : [
        "car",
        "tablet"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  
- **Configuration rules**:

  This tag consists of five attributes: [apiVersion](#apiversion), [screenShape](#screenshape), [screenWindow](#screenwindow), [screenDensity](#screendensity), and [countryCode](#countrycode).

  During distribution, a unique HAP is determined based on the mapping between **deviceTypes** and the preceding attributes.

  * When configuring this tag, include at least one of the attributes.
  * If any one or more attributes are set for one entry-type module, the same attributes must be set for all other entry-type modules.
  * The **screenShape** and **screenWindow** attributes are available only for lite wearables.

- **Configuration**:

  This tag must be configured in the **/resource/profile** directory and be referenced in the **resource** field of **metadata**.
