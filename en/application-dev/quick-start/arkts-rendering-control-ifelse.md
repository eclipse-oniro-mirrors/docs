# if/else: Conditional Rendering


ArkTS provides conditional rendering. It supports the use of the **if**, **else**, and **else if** statements to display different content based on the application state.

> **NOTE**
>
> This API can be used in ArkTS widgets since API version 9.

## Rules of Use

- The **if**, **else**, and **else if** statements are supported.

- The conditional statements following **if** and **else if** can use state variables.

- Conditional statements can be used within a container component to build different child components.

- Conditional statements are "transparent" when it comes to the parent-child relationship of components. Rules about permissible child components must be followed when there is one or more **if** statements between the parent and child components.

- The build function inside each conditional branch must follow the special rules for build functions. Each of such build functions must create one or more components. An empty build function that creates no components will result in a syntax error.

- Some container components impose restrictions on the type or number of child components. When conditional statements are used in such components, these restrictions also apply to the components to be created by using the conditional statements. For example, when a conditional statement is used in the **\<Grid>** container component, whose child components can only be **\<GridItem>**, only the **\<GridItem>** component can be used in the conditional statement.


## Update Mechanism

A conditional statement updates whenever a state variable used inside the **if** or **else if** condition changes. Specifically:

1. The conditional statement re-evaluates the conditions. If the evaluation of the conditions changes, steps 2 and 3 are performed. Otherwise, no follow-up operation is required.

2. The ArkUI framework removes all child components that have been built.

3. The ArkUI framework executes the build function of the conditional branch again to add the generated child component to its parent component. If an applicable **else** branch is missing, no new build function will be executed.

A condition can include Typescript expressions. As for any expression inside build functions, such an expression must not change any application state.


## Use Scenarios


### Using if for Conditional Rendering


```ts
@Entry
@Component
struct ViewA {
  @State count: number = 0;

  build() {
    Column() {
      Text(`count=${this.count}`)

      if (this.count > 0) {
        Text(`count is positive`)
          .fontColor(Color.Green)
      }

      Button('increase count')
        .onClick(() => {
          this.count++;
        })

      Button('decrease count')
        .onClick(() => {
          this.count--;
        })
    }
  }
}
```

Each branch of the **if** statement includes a build function. Each of such build functions must create one or more components. On initial render, **if** will execute a build function and add the generated child component to its parent component.

**if** updates whenever a state variable used inside the **if** or **else if** condition changes, and re-evaluates the conditions. If the evaluation of the conditions changes, it means that another branch of **if** needs to be built. In this case, the ArkUI framework will:

1. Remove all previously rendered components (of the earlier branch).

2. Execute the build function of the branch and add the generated child component to its parent component.

In the preceding example, if **count** increases from 0 to 1, then **if** updates, the condition **count > 0** is re-evaluated, and the evaluation result changes from **false** to **true**. Therefore, the positive branch build function will be executed, which creates a **\<Text>** component and adds it to the **\<Column>** parent component. If **count** changes back to 0 later, then the **\<Text>** component will be removed from the **\<Column>** component. Since there is no **else** branch, no new build function will be executed.


### if ... else ... and Child Component States

This example involves **if...** **else...** and a child component with an \@State decorated variable.


```ts
@Component
struct CounterView {
  @State counter: number = 0;
  label: string = 'unknown';

  build() {
    Row() {
      Text(`${this.label}`)
      Button(`counter ${this.counter} +1`)
        .onClick(() => {
          this.counter += 1;
        })
    }
  }
}

@Entry
@Component
struct MainView {
  @State toggle: boolean = true;

  build() {
    Column() {
      if (this.toggle) {
        CounterView({ label: 'CounterView #positive' })
      } else {
        CounterView({ label: 'CounterView #negative' })
      }
      Button(`toggle ${this.toggle}`)
        .onClick(() => {
          this.toggle = !this.toggle;
        })
    }
  }
}
```

On first render, the **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#positive'**) child component is created. This child component carries the \@State decorated variable, named **counter**. When the **CounterView.counter** state variable is updated, the **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#positive'**) child component is re-rendered, with its state variable value preserved. When the value of the **MainView.toggle** state variable changes to **false**, the **if** statement inside the **MainView** parent component gets updated, and subsequently the **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#positive'**) child component is removed. At the same time, a new **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#negative'**) child component is created, with the **counter** state variable set to the initial value **0**.

> **NOTE**
>
> **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#positive'**) and **CounterView** (label: **'CounterView \#negative'**) are two distinct instances of the same custom component. When the **if** branch changes, there is no update to an existing child component or no preservation of state.

The following example shows the required modifications if the value of **counter** needs to be preserved when the **if** condition changes:


```
@Component
struct CounterView {
  @Link counter: number;
  label: string = 'unknown';

  build() {
    Row() {
      Text(`${this.label}`)
      Button(`counter ${this.counter} +1`)
        .onClick(() => {
          this.counter += 1;
        })
    }
  }
}

@Entry
@Component
struct MainView {
  @State toggle: boolean = true;
  @State counter: number = 0;

  build() {
    Column() {
      if (this.toggle) {
        CounterView({ counter: $counter, label: 'CounterView #positive' })
      } else {
        CounterView({ counter: $counter, label: 'CounterView #negative' })
      }
      Button(`toggle ${this.toggle}`)
        .onClick(() => {
          this.toggle = !this.toggle;
        })
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the \@State decorated variable **counter** is owned by the parent component. Therefore, it is not destroyed when a **CounterView** component instance is destroyed. The **CounterView** component refers to the state by an \@Link decorator. The state must be moved from a child to its parent (or parent of parent) to avoid losing it when the conditional content (or repeated content) is destroyed.


### Nested if Statements

The nesting of **if** statements makes no difference to the rule about the parent component.


```ts
@Entry
@Component
struct CompA {
  @State toggle: boolean = false;
  @State toggleColor: boolean = false;

  build() {
    Column() {
      Text('Before')
        .fontSize(15)
      if (this.toggle) {
        Text('Top True, positive 1 top')
          .backgroundColor('#aaffaa').fontSize(20)
        // Inner if statement
        if (this.toggleColor) {
          Text('Top True, Nested True, positive COLOR  Nested ')
            .backgroundColor('#00aaaa').fontSize(15)
        } else {
          Text('Top True, Nested False, Negative COLOR  Nested ')
            .backgroundColor('#aaaaff').fontSize(15)
        }
      } else {
        Text('Top false, negative top level').fontSize(20)
          .backgroundColor('#ffaaaa')
        if (this.toggleColor) {
          Text('positive COLOR  Nested ')
            .backgroundColor('#00aaaa').fontSize(15)
        } else {
          Text('Negative COLOR  Nested ')
            .backgroundColor('#aaaaff').fontSize(15)
        }
      }
      Text('After')
        .fontSize(15)
      Button('Toggle Outer')
        .onClick(() => {
          this.toggle = !this.toggle;
        })
      Button('Toggle Inner')
        .onClick(() => {
          this.toggleColor = !this.toggleColor;
        })
    }
  }
}
```
