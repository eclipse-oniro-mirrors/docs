# Application Package Update Process
The OpenHarmony bundle manager service allows application packages to be updated under the following scenarios:

1. In the application market: The application market notifies the user of an available update, and the user can install the update by following the onscreen instructions.
2. In the application: When the application for which an update is available starts up, the application market notifies the user of the update, and the user can install the update by following the onscreen instructions.
