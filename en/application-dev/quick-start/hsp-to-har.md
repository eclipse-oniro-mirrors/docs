# Converting HSP to HAR
The HSP has requirements on the consistency of bundle names and signatures and the HSP file needs to be installed in the debugging phase. As a result, many integration problems occur in multi-module integration development. In this case, you are advised to use the HAR file to avoid these problems. This topic describes how to convert an HSP project to an HAR project by changing the configuration items.
## How to Convert

1. In the **module.json5** file of the HSP module, change the value of the **type** field to **har** and delete the **deliveryWithInstall** and **pages** fields.
    ```json
    // MyApplication\library\src\main\module.json5
    {
        "module": {
            "name": "har",
            "type": "har",
            "deviceTypes": [
            "default",
            "tablet",
            "2in1"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
2. Delete the **main_pages.json** file from the **resource\base\profile** folder.

3. Replace the content in the **hvigorfile.ts** file of the HSP module with the following content:
    ```ts
    // MyApplication\library\hvigorfile.ts
    import { harTasks } from '@ohos/hvigor-ohos-plugin';

    export default {
        system: harTasks,  /* Built-in plugin of Hvigor. It cannot be modified. */
        plugins:[]         /* Custom plugin to extend the functionality of Hvigor. */
    }
    ```

4. Delete the **packageType** configuration from the **oh-package.json5** file.

5. Modify the project-level **build-profile.json5** configuration file and delete **targets** from the HSP configuration in the **modules** module.
