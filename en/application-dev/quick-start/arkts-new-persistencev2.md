# PersistenceV2: Persisting Application State

To enhance the state management framework's capability of persistently storing UIs, you can use **PersistenceV2** to persist data. During application development, you may want selected attributes to persist even when the application is closed. In this case, you'll need **PersistenceV2**.

**PersistenceV2** is an optional singleton object within an application. Its purpose is to persist UI-related data so that their values are the same upon application re-start as they were when the application was closed.

**PersistenceV2** provides the state variable persistence capability. You can bind the same key through **connect** to implement the persistence capability during state variable change and application cold start.

Before reading this topic, you are advised to read [\@ComponentV2](./arkts-new-componentV2.md), [\@ObservedV2 and \@Trace](./arkts-new-observedV2-and-trace.md), and API reference of [PersistentV2](../reference/apis-arkui/js-apis-StateManagement.md).

>**NOTE**
>
>**PersistenceV2** is supported since API version 12.

## Overview

**PersistenceV2** is a singleton to be created when the application UI is started. Its purpose is to provide central storage for application UI state attributes. Each attribute is accessed using a unique key, which is a string. Unlike **AppStorageV2**, **PersistenceV2** also persistently stores the latest data on device disks. In this way, the selected result can still be saved even when the application is closed.

For a [\@ObservedV2](arkts-new-observedV2-and-trace.md) object associated with **PersistenceV2**, the change of the [\@Trace](arkts-new-observedV2-and-trace.md) attribute of the object triggers **automatic persistence of the entire associated object**. If necessary, you can call **PersistenceV2** APIs to manually perform persistence.

**PersistenceV2** can synchronize application state attributes with UI components and can be accessed during implementation of application service logic as well.

**PersistenceV2** supports state sharing among multiple UIAbility instances in the [main thread](../application-models/thread-model-stage.md) of an application.

## How to Use

### connect: Creating or Obtaining Stored Data

```JavaScript
static connect<T extends object>(
    type: TypeConstructorWithArgs<T>,
    keyOrDefaultCreator?: string | StorageDefaultCreator<T>,
    defaultCreator?: StorageDefaultCreator<T> 
): T | undefined;
```

| connect      | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter        | **type**: specified type. If no **key** is specified, the name of the **type** is used as the **key**.<br> **keyOrDefaultCreater**: specified key or default constructor.<br> **defaultCreator**: default constructor.                                         |
| Return value      | After creating or obtaining data, value is returned. Otherwise, **undefined** is returned.|

>**NOTE**
>
>1. The third parameter is used when no **key** is specified or the second parameter is invalid. Otherwise, the second parameter is used.
>
>2. If the data has been stored in **PersistenceV2**, you can obtain the stored data without using the default constructor. Otherwise, you must specify the default constructor. If no constructor is specified, the application exception occurs.
>
>3. Ensure that the data types match the key. If different types of data are connected to the same key, the application exception occurs.
>
>4. You are advised to use meaningful values for keys. The values can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_) and a maximum of 255 characters. Using invalid characters or null characters will result in undefined behavior.
>
>5. When matching the key with the [\@Observed](arkts-observed-and-objectlink.md) object, specify the key or customize the **name** attribute.

### remove: Deleting the Stored Data of a Specified Key

```JavaScript
static remove<T>(keyOrType: string | TypeConstructorWithArgs<T>): void;
```

| remove       | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter        | **keyOrType**: key to be deleted. If the key is of the **type**, the key to be deleted is the name of the **type**.                                         |
| Return value      | None.|

>**NOTE**
>
>If a key that does not exist in **PersistenceV2** is deleted, a warning is reported.

### keys: Returning All Keys Stored in PersistenceV2

```JavaScript
static keys(): Array<string>;
```

| keys         | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter        | None.                                        |
| Return value      | All keys in **PersistenceV2**.|


### save: Persisting Stored Data Manually

```JavaScript
static save<T>(keyOrType: string | TypeConstructorWithArgs<T>): void;
```

| save         | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter        | **keyOrType**: key that needs to be manually persist. If the key is of the **Type**, the key is the name of the **Type**.                                         |
| Return value      | None.|

>**NOTE**
>
>Changes to the non-[\@Trace](arkts-new-observedV2-and-trace.md) data do not trigger **PersistenceV2**. If necessary, call this API to persist the data of the corresponding key.
>
>It is useless to manually persist the keys that are not in the **connect** state in the memory.


### notifyOnError: Callback for Responding to a Serialization or Deserialization Failure

```JavaScript
static notifyOnError(callback: PersistenceErrorCallback | undefined): void;
```

| notifyOnError| Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Parameter        | **callback**: When a serialization or deserialization fails, the callback is executed. Pass in **undefined** can cancel this callback.|
| Return value      | None.|

>**NOTE**
>
>When data is stored to disks, the data needs to be serialized. If a key fails to be serialized, the error is unpredictable. As a result, this API can be called to capture exceptions.


## Constraints

1. This singleton must be used together with the UI thread only. Other threads, for example, @Sendable decorator is not supported.

2. Types such as collections.Set and collections.Map are not supported.

3. Non-buildin types, such as native PixelMap, NativePointer, and ArrayList types, are not supported.

4. A single key supports a maximum of 8 KB data. If the data is too large, the persistence fails.

5. The persistent data must be a class object. Containers, such as Array, Set, and Map, or objects of the built-in types, such as Date and Number, are not supported.

6. Objects that used for loop reference are not supported.

7. Automatic persistency is triggered only when [\@Trace](arkts-new-observedV2-and-trace.md) data is changed. The change of state variables in V1, [\@Observed](arkts-observed-and-objectlink.md) objects, and common data does not trigger persistency.

8. Do not store a large amount of persistent data. Otherwise, frame freezing may occur.

## Use Scenarios
### Storing Data Between Two Pages

Data page
```ts
// Sample.ets
import { Type } from '@kit.ArkUI';

// Data center
@ObservedV2
class SampleChild {
  @Trace p1: number = 0;
  p2: number = 10;
}

@ObservedV2
export class Sample {
  // For complex objects, use the @Type decorator to ensure successful serialization.
  @Type(SampleChild)
  @Trace f: SampleChild = new SampleChild();
}
```

Page 1
```ts
// Page1.ets
import { PersistenceV2 } from '@kit.ArkUI';
import { Sample } from '../Sample';

// Callback used to receive serialization failure.
PersistenceV2.notifyOnError((key: string, reason: string, msg: string) => {
  console.error(`error key: ${key}, reason: ${reason}, message: ${msg}`);
});

@Entry
@ComponentV2
struct Page1 {
  // Create a KV pair whose key is Sample in PersistenceV2 (if the key exists, the data in PersistenceV2 is returned) and associate it with prop.
  // Add @Local to decorate the prop attribute that needs to change the connected object. (Changing the connected object is not recommended.)
  @Local prop: Sample = PersistenceV2.connect(Sample, () => new Sample())!;
  pageStack: NavPathStack = new NavPathStack();

  build() {
    Navigation(this.pageStack) {
      Column() {
        Button('Go to page2')
          .onClick(() => {
            this.pageStack.pushPathByName('Page2', null);
          })

        Button('Page1 connect the key Sample')
          .onClick(() => {
            // Create a KV pair whose key is Sample in PersistenceV2 (if the key exists, the data in PersistenceV2 is returned) and associate it with prop.
            // Changing the connected object for the prop attribute is not recommended.
            this.prop = PersistenceV2.connect(Sample, 'Sample', () => new Sample())!;
          })

        Button('Page1 remove the key Sample')
          .onClick(() => {
            // After being deleted from PersistenceV2, prop will no longer be associated with the value whose key is Sample.
            PersistenceV2.remove(Sample);
          })

        Button('Page1 save the key Sample')
          .onClick(() => {
            // If the sample is in the connect state, persist the KV pair of the Sample.
            PersistenceV2.save(Sample);
          })

        Text(`Page1 add 1 to prop.p1: ${this.prop.f.p1}`)
          .fontSize(30)
          .onClick(() => {
            this.prop.f.p1++;
          })

        Text(`Page1 add 1 to prop.p2: ${this.prop.f.p2}`)
          .fontSize(30)
          .onClick(() => {
            // The page is not re-rendered, but the value of p2 is changed.
            this.prop.f.p2++;
          })

        // Obtain all keys in the current PersistenceV2.
        Text(`all keys in PersistenceV2: ${PersistenceV2.keys()}`)
          .fontSize(30)
      }
      }
  }
}
```

Page 2
```ts
// Page2.ets
import { PersistenceV2 } from '@kit.ArkUI';
import { Sample } from '../Sample';

@Builder
export function Page2Builder() {
  Page2()
}

@ComponentV2
struct Page2 {
  // Create a KV pair whose key is Sample in PersistenceV2 (if the key exists, the data in PersistenceV2 is returned) and associate it with prop.
  // Add @Local to decorate the prop attribute that needs to change the connected object. (Changing the connected object is not recommended.)
  @Local prop: Sample = PersistenceV2.connect(Sample, () => new Sample())!;
  pathStack: NavPathStack = new NavPathStack();

  build() {
    NavDestination() {
      Column() {
        Button('Page2 connect the key Sample1')
          .onClick(() => {
            // Create a KV pair whose key is Sample1 in PersistenceV2 (if the key exists, the data in PersistenceV2 is returned) and associate it with prop.
            // Changing the connected object for the prop attribute is not recommended.
            this.prop = PersistenceV2.connect(Sample, 'Sample1', () => new Sample())!;
          })

        Text(`Page2 add 1 to prop.p1: ${this.prop.f.p1}`)
          .fontSize(30)
          .onClick(() => {
            this.prop.f.p1++;
          })

        Text(`Page2 add 1 to prop.p2: ${this.prop.f.p2}`)
          .fontSize(30)
          .onClick(() => {
            // The page is not re-rendered, but the value of p2 is changed, which is performed after re-initialization.
            this.prop.f.p2++;
          })

        // Obtain all keys in the current PersistenceV2.
        Text(`all keys in PersistenceV2: ${PersistenceV2.keys()}`)
          .fontSize(30)
      }
    }
    .onReady((context: NavDestinationContext) => {
      this.pathStack = context.pathStack;
    })
  }
}
```
When using **Navigation**, you need to add the **route_map.json** file to the **src/main/resources/base/profile** directory, replace the value of **pageSourceFile** with the path of **Page2**, and add **"routerMap": "$profile: route_map"** to the **module.json5** file.
```json
{
  "routerMap": [
    {
      "name": "Page2",
      "pageSourceFile": "src/main/ets/pages/Page2.ets",
      "buildFunction": "Page2Builder",
      "data": {
        "description" : "AppStorageV2 example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
