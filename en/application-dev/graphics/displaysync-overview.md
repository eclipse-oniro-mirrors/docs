# Introduction to Variable Frame Rates

Nowadays, low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) screens are widely used. This type of screen supports switching between frame rates at multiple levels.

For fast-changing content, such as shooting games and interactive animations, a high frame rate is required. It ensures smooth images while causing a high power consumption.

For slow-changing content, such as game halls and clock update animations, a low frame rate is used. It consumes less power and does not cause frame freezing.

The variable frame rate capability enables you to achieve a balance between performance experience and power consumption on devices with the LTPO screens.

OpenHarmony supports this capability. You can use the variable frame rate APIs to develop related services.


## Use Scenarios
The variable frame rate capability allows you to specify the frame rate in different scenarios. Typical use scenarios are as follows:
- Configure the frame rate parameter for property animations or explicit animations. For details, see [Requesting Frame Rates for Animations](displaysync-animation.md).
- Request an independent frame rate for UI components. For details, see [Requesting Frame Rates for UI Components](displaysync-ui.md).
- Request an independent frame rate for custom content (such as gaming) through the **XComponent** on the native side. For details, see [Requesting Frame Rates for Custom Content](displaysync-xcomponent.md).
- Request an independent frame rate for drawing of non-UI threads through NativeVsync on the native side. For details, see [NativeDisplaySoloist Development (C/C++)](displaysoloist-native-guidelines.md).

## Working Principles
The variable frame rate provides the basic frame rate configuration for animation components, **XComponent**, and UI components.

After a valid expected frame rate is set, the system collects the configured frame rate and divides the frequency on the rendering pipeline.

## Constraints

The actual frame rate may be different from the expected one configured. It is limited by the system capability and screen refresh rate.
