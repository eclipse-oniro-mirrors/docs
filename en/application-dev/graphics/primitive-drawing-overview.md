# Overview of Primitive Drawing


No matter how complex a diagram is, it is composed of primitives. Canvas provides various primitive drawing functions to meet the drawing requirements of various primitives. This section describes how to draw geometric shapes (such as points, circles, and rectangles), images, and text blocks, and provides sample code for you to implement required UI effects.


Primitive drawing is the last step of drawing a primitive. Before drawing a primitive, you need to create a canvas and set the drawing effect as required.
