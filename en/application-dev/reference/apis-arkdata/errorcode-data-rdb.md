##  14800000 Internal Error

**Error Message**

Inner error.

**Description**

Internal error.

**Possible Causes**

View the error log to determine the cause of the error. Possible causes include the following:

**Description**

An SQLite generic error occurs.

**Possible Causes**

An SQL statement is executed to perform any of the following operations:
1. Insert or update data in a table that is not created.
2. Insert or update data in a column that does not exist.
3. Call an undefined function. For details, see SQLITE_ERROR.

**Solution**

## 14800022 SQLite: Asynchronous Callback Request Aborted

**Error Message**

SQLite: Callback routine requested an abort.

**Description**

The asynchronous callback request is aborted.

**Possible Causes**

Check that the hook functions (callbacks) of SQLite are implemented correctly.

## 14800023 SQLite: Access Denied

**Error Message**

SQLite: Access permission denied.

**Description**

SQLite access is denied.

**Possible Causes**

1. SQLite does not have the required permission to access or modify a file.
2. See SQLITE_PERM.

**Solution**

1. Ensure that the file is not read-only. If the file is read-only, remove the read-only property.
2. Check that the caller has the required permissions to access the file or folder.
3. Check whether the file system is read-only. If yes, change it to writable.
4. Check that the database file is not being used by another process. Terminate the process that is using the file.
5. When handling permission issues, ensure that you have the permission to change the permissions on the file or folder.

## 14800024 SQLite: Database File Locked

**Error Message**

SQLite: The database file is locked.

**Description**

The SQLite database file is locked.

**Possible Causes**

1. Two processes of the same application, for example, UIability and DataShareability, perform addition, deletion, and modification operations in the same database, or processes in the same group of different applications perform addition, deletion, and modification operations in the same database via the group.
2. See SQLITE_BUSY.

**Solution**

1. Avoid concurrent database operations from processes.
2. Wait for a while and try again.

## 14800025 SQLite: Database Table Locked

**Error Message**

SQLite: A table in the database is locked.

**Description**

An SQLite database table is locked.

**Possible Causes**

1. The database file to write has been locked by another process. A transaction is being performed in the RDB store, or the write attempt is blocked by a lock mechanism.
2. See SQLITE_LOCKED.

**Solution**

1. Check that the database file is not being written by another process or thread.
2. Check that no write operation is performed after a transaction is started and before the transaction is committed.
3. Check whether the write operation is blocked by other lock mechanisms (such as file locks).
4. Check that the database connection instance is closed after the database operation is complete.
5. In a multi-thread environment, ensure that synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, are used to prevent data races.

## 14800026 SQLite: Insufficient Database Memory

**Error Message**

SQLite: The database is out of memory.

**Description**

The database memory is insufficient.

**Possible Causes**
 
The data volume is too large or the memory allocated is insufficient.

**Solution**

Reduce the data volume or increase the memory allocated.

## 14800027 SQLite: Attempt to Write a Read-only Database

**Error Message**

SQLite: Attempt to write a readonly database.

**Description**

A write operation is invoked on a read-only database.

**Possible Causes**

1. An attempt is made to write an SQLite database file that is opened in read-only mode. The access is denied because the target file is in a read-only file system or the database is marked as read-only.
2. See SQLITE_READONLY.

**Solution**

1. Ensure that the caller has the permission to write data to the database file.
2. If the file system is read-only, change it to read/write.
3. Check that no read-only parameter is used when the database is opened.

## 14800028 SQLite: I/O Error

1. The target file does not exist.
2. The target file is read-only.
3. The disk space is insufficient.
4. The target file is damaged.
5. See SQLITE_IOERR.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the file path is correct and whether the file exists.
2. Check that the file is not read-only.
3. Delete unnecessary files to ensure sufficient disk space.
4. Check that the caller has permissions to read and write the file.

## 14800029 SQLite: Database Is Full

**Error Message**

SQLite: The database is full.

**Description**

The SQLite database is full.

**Possible Causes**

The data volume is too large or the disk space is insufficient.

**Solution**

Reduce the data volume or increase the disk space.

## 14800030 SQLite: Unable to Open the Database File

**Error Message**

2. The file exists, but the database file is damaged.
3. The caller does not have the permission to access the file using SQLite.
4. The disk space is insufficient.
5. See SQLITE_CANTOPEN.

**Solution**

1. Check that the database file path is correct and the caller has the permission to read and write the file.
2. Check that the disk space is sufficient.

## 14800031 SQLite: TEXT or BLOB Exceeds the Limit

**Error Message**

SQLite: TEXT or BLOB exceeds size limit.

**Description**

The size of the text or BLOB exceeds the limit.

**Possible Causes**

1. The result set returned exceeds the size limit that SQLite can process.
2. See SQLITE_TOOBIG.

**Solution**

Divide the query operation into multiple small queries, which process part of the data each time.

## 14800032 SQLite: Abort Due to Constraint Violation

**Error Message**

SQLite: Abort due to constraint violation.

**Description**

The database operation violates the constraint rule and is aborted.

**Possible Causes**

1. The data write operation violates the constraints on the database integrity.
2. See SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.

**Solution**

Check whether the data to be inserted or updated violates the constraints.

## 14800033 SQLite: Data Types Mismatch

**Error Message**

SQLite: Data type mismatch.

**Description**

The data types mismatch.

**Possible Causes**

1. The data type specified in an SQL statement does not match the type of the data stored in the database.
2. See SQLITE_MISMATCH.

**Solution**

Check the type of the data in the specified column in the SQL statement and ensure that the type of the data to be inserted, updated, or queried matches the data type of the column.

## 14800034 Incorrect Use of SQLite Library

**Error Message**

SQLite: Library used incorrectly.

**Description**

The SQLite interface is used incorrectly.

**Possible Causes**

1. The database operation or context is incorrect. This error usually occurs in the following cases:
    - The next operation is performed before a database operation is complete.
    - A database operation is performed on a closed database connection.
    - A released or invalid database object is used to perform data operation.
2. See SQLITE_MISUSE.

**Solution**

1. Check that proper synchronization mechanisms like locks are used between database operations.
2. Check that a database connection is opened before use and closed after the operation is complete.
3. Check that all database objects are correctly released after being used.

## 14800047 WAL File Size Exceeds the Default Limit

**Error Message**

The WAL file size exceeds the default limit.

**Description**

The WAL file exceeds 512 MB, which is the default limit.

**Solution**

Obtain **dataGroupId** from the AppGallery and pass it to **storeConfig** correctly.

## 14800051 Inconsistent Distributed Table Type

**Error Message**

The type of the distributed table does not match.

**Description**

Different distributed table types are set for the same database table.
