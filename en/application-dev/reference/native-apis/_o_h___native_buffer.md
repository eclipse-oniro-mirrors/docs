## Type Description


### OH_NativeBuffer


```
typedef struct OH_NativeBuffer OH_NativeBuffer
```

**Description**

Provides the declaration of an **OH_NativeBuffer** struct.


## Function Description


### OH_NativeBuffer_Alloc()


```
OH_NativeBuffer* OH_NativeBuffer_Alloc (const OH_NativeBuffer_Config * config)
```

**Description**

Creates an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance based on an **OH_NativeBuffer_Config** struct. A new **OH_NativeBuffer** instance is created each time this function is called.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| config | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer_Config** instance.|

**Returns**

Returns the pointer to the **OH_NativeBuffer** instance created if the operation is successful; returns **NULL** otherwise.


### OH_NativeBuffer_GetConfig()


```
void OH_NativeBuffer_GetConfig (OH_NativeBuffer * buffer, OH_NativeBuffer_Config * config )
```

**Description**

Obtains the attributes of an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| buffer | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.|
| config | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer_Config** instance, which is used to receive the attributes of **OH_NativeBuffer**.|


### OH_NativeBuffer_GetSeqNum()


```
uint32_t OH_NativeBuffer_GetSeqNum (OH_NativeBuffer * buffer)
```

**Description**

Obtains the sequence number of an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| buffer | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.|

**Returns**

Returns the unique sequence number of the **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.


### OH_NativeBuffer_Map()


```
int32_t OH_NativeBuffer_Map (OH_NativeBuffer * buffer, void ** virAddr )
```

**Description**

Maps the ION memory corresponding to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance to the process address space.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| buffer | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.|
| virAddr | Double pointer to the address of the virtual memory.|

**Returns**

Returns **0** if the operation is successful.


### OH_NativeBuffer_Reference()


```
int32_t OH_NativeBuffer_Reference (OH_NativeBuffer * buffer)
```

**Description**

Increases the reference count of an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance by 1.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| buffer | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.|

**Returns**

Returns **0** if the operation is successful.


### OH_NativeBuffer_Unmap()


```
int32_t OH_NativeBuffer_Unmap (OH_NativeBuffer * buffer)
```

**Description**

Unmaps the ION memory corresponding to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance from the process address space.

\@syscap SystemCapability.Graphic.Graphic2D.NativeBuffer

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| buffer | Pointer to an **OH_NativeBuffer** instance.|
