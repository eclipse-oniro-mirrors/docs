**Possible Causes**

1. One of the APIs that need to be used in pairs is repeatedly called.
2. One of the APIs that need to be used in pairs is independently called.

**Solution**

1. For the APIs that need to be used in pairs, for example, **on()** and **off()**, check whether **on()** with the same parameters is called again before **off()** is called.
2. For the APIs that need to be used in pairs, for example, **on()** and **off()**, check whether **off()** is called before **on()**.


## 12100005 Listener Overflows

## 12100006 Permission Granting or Revocation Not Supported

**Error Message**

The specified application does not support the permissions granted or ungranted as specified.

**Possible Causes**
