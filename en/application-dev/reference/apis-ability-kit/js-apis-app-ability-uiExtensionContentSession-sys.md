# @ohos.app.ability.UIExtensionContentSession (UI Operation Class for ExtensionAbilities with UI) (System API)

**UIExtensionContentSession** is an instance created when the [UIExtensionAbility](js-apis-app-ability-uiExtensionAbility.md) loads UI content. When the UIExtensionComponent starts a UIExtensionAbility, the UIExtensionAbility creates a UIExtensionContentSession instance and returns it through the [onSessionCreate](js-apis-app-ability-uiExtensionAbility.md#uiextensionabilityonsessioncreate) callback. One UIExtensionComponent corresponds to one **UIExtensionContentSession** instance, which provides methods such as UI loading and result notification. The **UIExtensionContentSession** instances of multiple UIExtensionAbilities are operated separately.
