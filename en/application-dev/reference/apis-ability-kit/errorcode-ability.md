## 16000001 Ability Name Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

The specified ability does not exist.

**Description**

This error code is reported when the specified ability name does not exist.

The ability to query does not exist.

**Solution**

1. Pass in correct values of **bundleName**, **moduleName**, and **abilityName** in **want**.
2. Check whether the application corresponding to **bundleName** in **want** is installed. You can run the following command to query the list of installed applications. If **bundleName** is not in the query result, the application is not installed.
    ```
    hdc shell bm dump -a
    ```
3. For a multi-HAP application, check whether the HAP to which the ability belongs is installed. You can run the following command to query the bundle information. If the installed application does not contain the corresponding HAP and ability, the HAP to which the ability belongs is not installed.
    ```
    hdc shell bm dump -n bundleName
    ```
