# @ohos.app.ability.AbilityConstant (AbilityConstant)

The **AbilityConstant** module defines the UIAbility-related enums, including the initial launch reasons, reasons for the last exit, ability continuation results, and window modes.

> **NOTE**
> 
> - The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 9. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
> 
> - The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import { AbilityConstant } from '@kit.AbilityKit';
```

## LaunchParam
