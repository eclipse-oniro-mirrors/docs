## 22700101 Insufficient Memory

**Error Message**

No memory.

**Error Description**

This error code is reported if a memory allocation failure or null pointer occurs when an API is called.

**Possible Causes**

1. The system does not have sufficient memory for mapping.
2. Invalid instances are not destroyed in time to release the memory.

**Solution**

1. Stop the current operation or suspend other applications to free up memory.

**Error Description**

This error code is reported if an error occurs while the enrollment engine is initialized.

**Possible Cause**

1. Repeated initialization.
2. Lack of resources for initialization of the enrollment engine.

**Solution**

1. Avoid performing initialization repeatedly.
2. Ensure that the resources required for initialization, such as acoustic model files, are ready.

## 22700104 Enrollment Commit Failure
