# CommonEventPublishData

The **CommonEventPublishData** module provides APIs for defining common event content and attributes.

> **NOTE**
>
> The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 7. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>
> If there is no restriction, any application can subscribe to common events and read related information. In this case, sensitive information should not be carried in common events. The **subscriberPermissions** and **bundleName** parameters of this module can be used to restrict the receiving scope of common events.
