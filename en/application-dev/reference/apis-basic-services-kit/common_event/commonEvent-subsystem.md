# Common Events of the xxx Subsystem
This document lists the common system events provided by the xxx subsystem/service to applications. Applications can use [APIs](../js-apis-commonEventManager.md) to subscribe to common system events.

## commonEvent1 (Event name)
// In the first paragraph, describe the event succinctly.

- Value: "usual.event.xx"
- Required subscriber permissions: xxx/none

// In the second paragraph, describe the event reporting mechanism in detail to help developers understand what action will trigger the event.

// (Optional) In the third paragraph, describe the variables (if any) on which the triggering of the event depends. For example, if the triggering of the event depends on the return value or callback of an API in the subsystem, provide here an explanation and, if necessary, a link to the API.
