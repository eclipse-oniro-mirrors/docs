# Universal Events


Unlike private events, universal events can be bound to most components. (If a keyup event needs to be triggered to respond to the input of carriage return and space characters on the keyboard, add the click event to the outermost component.)

> **NOTE**

>The APIs of this module are supported since API version 8. Updates will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
