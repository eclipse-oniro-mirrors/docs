**<tab-content\>** is a child component of **[<tabs\>](js-components-container-tabs.md)** and is used to provide the area for displaying the tab content. By default, its height is such that all the remaining space of the **<tabs\>** component is filled. The child components are arranged horizontally. When **<tab-content\>** is used as a child element in a container, its length along the main axis must be specified. Otherwise, it cannot be displayed. **\<tab-content>** does not support page scrolling. If page scrolling is required, consider nesting a list.
