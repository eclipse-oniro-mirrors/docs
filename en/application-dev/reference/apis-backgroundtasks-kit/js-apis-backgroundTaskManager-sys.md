# @ohos.backgroundTaskManager (Background Task Management) (System API)

The **BackgroundTaskManager** module provides APIs to manage background tasks.

If a service needs to be continued when the application or service module is running in the background (not visible to users), the application or service module can request a transient task to delay the suspension or a continuous task to prevent the suspension.

If an application has a task that needs to be continued when the application is switched to the background and can be completed within a short period of time, the application can request a transient task. For example, if a user chooses to clear junk files in the **Files** application and exits the application, the application can request a transient task to complete the cleanup.

If an application has a service that can be intuitively perceived by users and needs to run in the background for a long period of time (for example, music playback in the background), the application can request a continuous task.

If a privileged system application needs to use certain system resources (for example, it wants to receive common events when suspended), it can request efficiency resources.
