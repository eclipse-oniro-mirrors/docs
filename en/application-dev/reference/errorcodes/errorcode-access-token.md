# Application Access Control Error Codes

> **NOTE**
>
> This topic describes only module-specific error codes. For details about universal error codes, see [Universal Error Codes](errorcode-universal.md).

## 12100001 Invalid Parameters

**Error Message**

Parameter invalid, message is ${messageInfo}.

**Possible Causes**

This error code is reported if an error occurs during parameter verification. The possible causes are as follows:
- The value of **tokenId** is **0**.
- The permission name is empty or exceeds 256 characters.
- The **flag** value in the permission authorization or revocation request is invalid.
- The input parameters specified for registering a listener are incorrect.

**Solution**

Correct the invalid parameter values.


## 12100002 TokenId Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

TokenId does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

- The specified **tokenId** does not exist.
- The process of the specified **tokenId** is not an application process.

**Solution**

Set **tokenId** correctly.


## 12100003 Permission Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

Permission does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

- The specified **permissionName** does not exist.
- The specified **permissionName** does not match the **tokenId** in the permission authorization or revocation scenario.
- The specified **permissionName** is not a sensitive permission that requires user authorization.

**Solution**

Set the **permissionName** parameter correctly. For details, see [permission-list](../../security/permission-list.md).


## 12100004 Listener APIs Not Used in Pairs

**Error Message**

The interface is not used together.

**Possible Causes**

This error code is reported if listener APIs are not used in pairs. The possible causes are as follows:
1. The listener APIs that need to be used in pairs are repeatedly called.
2. The listener APIs that need to be used in pairs are independently called.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the API needs to be used in pairs. That is, if an API is called to enable listening, an API with the same input parameters cannot be called unless an API is called to stop listening first.
2. Check whether the API needs to be used in pairs. That is, an API for disabling listening or unregistering a listener can only be called after the API for enabling listening or registering a listener is called.


## 12100005 Listener Overflow

**Error Message**

The number of listeners exceeds the limit.

**Possible Causes**

The number of listeners exceeds 200 (the upper limit).

**Solution**

Release unused listeners in a timely manner.


## 12100006 Permission Granting or Revocation Not Supported for the Specified Application

**Error Message**

The specified application does not support the permissions granted or ungranted as specified.

**Possible Causes**

1. The specified **tokenId** is the identity of the remote device. Distributed permission granting and revocation are not yet supported.
2. The specified **tokenId** belongs to a sandbox application, which is not allowed to apply for the specified permission.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the method of obtaining **tokenId** is correct.
2. Check whether the sandbox application works in restrictive mode. Most permissions cannot be granted to a sandbox application in restrictive mode.


## 12100007 System Services Not Working Properly

**Error Message**

Service is abnormal.

**Possible Causes**

This error code is reported if system services are not working properly. The possible causes are as follows:
- The permission management service cannot start properly.
- The read or write of IPC data fails.

**Solution**

System services do not work properly. Try again later or restart the device.


## 12100008 Out of Memory

**Error Message**

Out of memory.

**Possible Causes**

The system memory is insufficient.

**Solution**

Try again later or restart the device.
