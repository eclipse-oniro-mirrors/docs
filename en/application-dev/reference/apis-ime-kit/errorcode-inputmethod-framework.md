## 12800001 Package Manager Error

**Error Message**

Package manager error.

**Description**

This error code is reported when an API of the package manager, such as **getInputMethods** and **listCurrentInputMethodSubtype**, fails to be called to obtain information.

None

## 12800002 Input Method Engine Error

**Error Message**

Input method engine error.

**Description**

This error code is reported when an input method API fails to be called.

**Possible Causes**

The input method process is suspended.

**Solution**

Check whether the input method process is running properly. For example, click the text input box in an application to check whether the input keyboard is displayed.

## 12800003 Input Method Client Error

**Error Message**

Input method client error.

**Description**

This error code is reported when the API for showing or hiding the keyboard fails to be called by a third-party application.

**Possible Causes**

The input method is disconnected from the third-party application due to a service error with the application.

**Solution**

Bind the input method to the third-party application again: Close the background process of the third-party application, start the application again, and touch a text input box. If the keyboard is displayed properly, the issue is resolved.

## 12800004 Not an Input Method

**Error Message**

Not an input method extension.

**Description**

This error code is reported when an API exclusive to input methods is called by an application of another type.

**Solution**

Call the API only in an input method.

## 12800005 Configuration Persistence Error

**Error Message**

Configuration persisting error.

**Description**

This error code is reported when the configuration fails to be saved during input method switching.

**Possible Causes**

An exception occurs with the system parameter configuration module.

**Solution**
