### OH_NN_TensorType

```
enum OH_NN_TensorType
```

**Description**

Defines tensor types.

Tensors are usually used to set the input, output, and operator parameters of a model. When a tensor is used as the input or output of a model (or operator), set the tensor type to **OH_NN_TENSOR**. When the tensor is used as an operator parameter, select an enumerated value other than **OH_NN_TENSOR** as the tensor type. Assume that **pad** of the **OH_NN_OPS_CONV2D** operator is being set. You need to set the **type** attribute of the **OH_NN_Tensor** instance to **OH_NN_CONV2D_PAD**. The settings of other operator parameters are similar. The enumerated values are named in the format OH_NN_{*Operator name*}_{*Attribute name*}.

## Function Description


### OH_NNCompilation_AddExtensionConfig()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_AddExtensionConfig (OH_NNCompilation *compilation, const char *configName, const void *configValue, const size_t configValueSize )
```

**Description**

Adds extended configurations for custom device attributes.

Some devices have their own attributes, which have not been enabled in NNRt. This API helps you to set custom attributes for these devices. You need to obtain their names and values from the device vendor's documentation and add them to the model building instance. These attributes are passed directly to the device driver. If the device driver cannot parse the attributes, this API returns an error code.

After [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build) is called, **configName** and **configValue** can be released.

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|
| configName | Configuration name.|
| configValue | Configured value.|
| configValueSize | Size of the configured value, in bytes.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).


### OH_NNCompilation_Build()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_Build (OH_NNCompilation *compilation)
```

**Description**

Performs model building.

After the build configuration is complete, call this API to start model building. The model building instance pushes the model and build options to the device for building. After this API is called, additional build operations cannot be performed. If [OH_NNCompilation_SetDevice](#oh_nncompilation_setdevice), [OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache), [OH_NNCompilation_SetPerformanceMode](#oh_nncompilation_setperformancemode), [OH_NNCompilation_SetPriority](#oh_nncompilation_setpriority), or [OH_NNCompilation_EnableFloat16](#oh_nncompilation_enablefloat16) is called, **OH_NN_OPERATION_FORBIDDEN** is returned.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).


### OH_NNCompilation_Construct()

```
OH_NNCompilation *OH_NNCompilation_Construct (const OH_NNModel *model)
```

**Description**

Creates a model building instance of the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) type.

After the OH_NNModel module completes model construction, APIs provided by the OH_NNCompilation module pass the model to underlying device for building. This API creates an [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance based on the passed [OH_NNModel](#oh_nnmodel) instance. The [OH_NNCompilation_SetDevice](#oh_nncompilation_setdevice) API is called to specify the device for model building, and the [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build) API is then called to complete model building.

In addition to computing device selection, the OH_NNCompilation module supports features such as model cache, performance preference, priority setting, and float16 computing, which can be implemented by the following APIs:

[OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache)

[OH_NNCompilation_SetPerformanceMode](#oh_nncompilation_setperformancemode)

[OH_NNCompilation_SetPriority](#oh_nncompilation_setpriority)

[OH_NNCompilation_EnableFloat16](#oh_nncompilation_enablefloat16)

After this API is called to create [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation), the [OH_NNModel](#oh_nnmodel) instance can be released.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| model | Pointer to the [OH_NNModel](#oh_nnmodel) instance.|

**Returns**

Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance. If the operation fails, **NULL** is returned.


### OH_NNCompilation_ConstructForCache()

```
OH_NNCompilation *OH_NNCompilation_ConstructForCache ()
```

**Description**

Creates an empty model building instance for later recovery from the model cache.

For details about the model cache, see [OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache).

The time required for model recovery from the model cache is less than the time required for building using [OH_NNModel](#oh_nnmodel).

Call [OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache) or [OH_NNCompilation_ImportCacheFromBuffer](#oh_nncompilation_importcachefrombuffer), and then call [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build) to complete model recovery.

**Since**: 11

**Returns**

Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance. If the operation fails, **NULL** is returned.


### OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelBuffer()

```
OH_NNCompilation *OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelBuffer (const void *modelBuffer, size_t modelSize )
```

**Description**

Creates a model building instance based on the offline model buffer.

This API conflicts with the one for transferring the path of the online or offline model building file. You can select only one of the three build APIs.

Note: The returned [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance only saves the modelBuffer pointer in it, but does not copy its data. The modelBuffer should not be released before the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance is destroyed.

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| modelBuffer | Memory for storing offline model files.|
| modelSize | Memory size of the offline model.|

**Returns**

Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance. If the operation fails, **NULL** is returned.


### OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelFile()

```
OH_NNCompilation *OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelFile (const char *modelPath)
```

**Description**

Creates a model building instance based on an offline model file.

This API conflicts with the one for transferring the memory of the online or offline model building file. You can select only one of the three build APIs.

An offline model is a model type built offline by the model converter provided by the device vendor. Therefore, an offline model can be used only on a specified device. However, the build time of an offline model is usually far shorter than that of the image composition instance [OH_NNModel](#oh_nnmodel).

During development, offline build needs to be performed and offline models need to be deployed in application packages.

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| modelPath | Path of the offline model file.|

**Returns**

Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance. If the operation fails, **NULL** is returned.


### OH_NNCompilation_Destroy()

```
void OH_NNCompilation_Destroy (OH_NNCompilation **compilation)
```

**Description**

Destroys a model building instance of the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) type.

This API needs to be called to destroy the model building instances created by calling [OH_NNCompilation_Construct](#oh_nncompilation_construct), [OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelFile](#oh_nncompilation_constructwithofflinemodelfile), [OH_NNCompilation_ConstructWithOfflineModelBuffer](#oh_nncompilation_constructwithofflinemodelbuffer) and [OH_NNCompilation_ConstructForCache](#oh_nncompilation_constructforcache).

If **compilation** or **\*compilation** is a null pointer, this API only prints warning logs but does not perform the destruction operation.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Level-2 pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance. After the model building instance is destroyed, this API sets **\*compilation** to a null pointer.|

### OH_NNCompilation_EnableFloat16()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_EnableFloat16 (OH_NNCompilation *compilation, bool enableFloat16 )
```

**Description**

Enables float16 for computing.

By default, the floating-point model uses float32 for computing. If this API is called on a device that supports float16, floating-point model that supports float32 will use float16 for computing, so to reduce memory usage and execution time.

This option is invalid for fixed-point models, for example, fixed-point models of the int8 type.

If this API is called on the device that does not support float16, the error code **OH_NN_UNAVAILABLE_DEVICE** is returned.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|
| enableFloat16 | Whether to enable float16. If this parameter is set to **true**, float16 inference is performed. If this parameter is set to **false**, float32 inference is performed.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).


### OH_NNCompilation_ExportCacheToBuffer()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_ExportCacheToBuffer (OH_NNCompilation *compilation, const void *buffer, size_t length, size_t *modelSize )
```

**Description**

Writes the model cache to the specified buffer.

For details about the model cache, see [OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache).

Note: The model cache is the build result [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build). Therefore, this API must be called after [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build).

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|
| buffer | Pointer to the given memory.|
| length | Memory length. |
| modelSize | Size of the model cache, in bytes.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).


### OH_NNCompilation_ImportCacheFromBuffer()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_ImportCacheFromBuffer (OH_NNCompilation *compilation, const void *buffer, size_t modelSize )
```

**Description**

Reads the model cache from the specified buffer.

For details about the model cache, see [OH_NNCompilation_SetCache](#oh_nncompilation_setcache).

After calling [OH_NNCompilation_ImportCacheFromBuffer](#oh_nncompilation_importcachefrombuffer), call [OH_NNCompilation_Build](#oh_nncompilation_build) to complete model recovery.

Note: The **compilation** instance stores the buffer pointer in the buffer, but does not copy its data. You cannot release the memory buffer before the **compilation** instance is destroyed.

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|
| buffer | Pointer to the given memory.|

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).


### OH_NNCompilation_SetCache()

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNCompilation_SetCache (OH_NNCompilation *compilation, const char *cachePath, uint32_t version )
```

**Description**

Sets the cache directory and version for model building.

On the device that supports model caching, a model can be saved as a cache file after being built at the device driver layer. The model can be directly read from the cache file in the next build, saving the rebuild time. This API performs different operations based on the model cache directory and version:

- If no file exists in the specified model cache directory, cache the built model to the directory and set the cache version to the value of **version**.

- If a complete cached file exists in the specified model cache directory, and its version number is equal to **version**, read the cached file in the directory and pass it to the underlying device to convert it into an executable model instance.

- If a complete cached file exists in the specified model cache directory, but its version is earlier than **version**, update the cached file. After the model is built in the underlying device, the cached file in the cache directory is overwritten and the version is updated to **version**.

- If a complete cached file exists in the specified model cache directory, but its version is later than **version**, the cached file is not read and the error code **OH_NN_INVALID_PARAMETER** is returned.

- If the cached file in the specified model cache directory is incomplete or you do not have the file access permission, the error code **OH_NN_INVALID_FILE** is returned.

- If the model cache directory does not exist or you do not have the file access permission, the error code **OH_NN_INVALID_PATH** is returned.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| compilation | Pointer to the [OH_NNCompilation](#oh_nncompilation) instance.|
| cachePath | Directory for storing model cache files. This API creates model cache directories for different devices in the cachePath directory. You are advised to use a separate cache directory for each model.|
| version | Cached model version.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).

```

**Description**

Sets the performance mode for model computing.

NNRt allows you to set the performance mode for model computing to meet the requirements of low power consumption and ultimate performance. If this API is not called to set the performance mode in the build phase, the model building instance assigns the **OH_NN_PERFORMANCE_NONE** mode for the model by default. In this case, the device performs computing in the default performance mode.

If this API is called on a device that does not support setting of the performance mode, the error code **OH_NN_UNAVAILABLE_DEVICE** is returned.

**Since**: 9

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|

**Description**

Performs asynchronous inference.

You need to create the input and output tensors by calling [OH_NNTensor_Create](#oh_nntensor_create), [OH_NNTensor_CreateWithSize](#oh_nntensor_createwithsize), or [OH_NNTensor_CreateWithFd](#oh_nntensor_createwithfd).

Then, call [OH_NNTensor_GetDataBuffer](#oh_nntensor_getdatabuffer) o obtain the pointer to the tensor data and copies the input data to it. The executor performs model inference, generates the inference result, and writes the result to the output tensor.

If the output tensor has a dynamic shape, you can obtain the actual shape of the output tensor by calling [OH_NNExecutor_GetOutputShape](#oh_nnexecutor_getoutputshape). Alternatively, obtain the tensor description from the input tensor by calling [OH_NNTensor_GetTensorDesc](#oh_nntensor_gettensordesc), and then obtain the actual shape by calling [OH_NNTensorDesc_GetShape](#oh_nntensordesc_getshape).

This API works in non-blocking mode and returns the result immediately after being called. You can obtain the inference result and execution return status through the [NN_OnRunDone](#nn_onrundone) callback. If the device driver service stops abnormally during execution, you can use the [NN_OnServiceDied](#nn_onservicedied) callback for exception processing.

You can set the [NN_OnRunDone](#nn_onrundone) and [NN_OnServiceDied](#nn_onservicedied) callbacks by calling [OH_NNExecutor_SetOnRunDone](#oh_nnexecutor_setonrundone) and [OH_NNExecutor_SetOnServiceDied](#oh_nnexecutor_setonservicedied).

If the inference times out, it is terminated immediately and the error code **OH_NN_TIMEOUT** is returned through the [NN_OnRunDone](#nn_onrundone) callback.

**userData** is the identifier used to distinguish different asynchronous inferences and is returned as the first parameter in the callback. You can use any data that can distinguish different inferences as the identifier.

Then, call [OH_NNTensor_GetDataBuffer](#oh_nntensor_getdatabuffer) o obtain the pointer to the tensor data and copies the input data to it. The executor performs model inference, generates the inference result, and writes the result to the output tensor.

If the output tensor has a dynamic shape, you can obtain the actual shape of the output tensor by calling [OH_NNExecutor_GetOutputShape](#oh_nnexecutor_getoutputshape).

```

**Description**

Sets the data for a single model input.

This API copies the data whose length is specified by **length** (in bytes) in **dataBuffer** to the shared memory of the underlying device. **inputIndex** specifies the input to be set and **tensor** sets tensor information such as the shape, type, and quantization parameters.

NNRt supports models with dynamical shape input. For fixed shape input and dynamic shape input scenarios, this API uses different processing policies.

- - Fixed shape input: The attributes of **tensor** must be the same as those of the tensor added by calling [OH_NNModel_AddTensor](#oh_nnmodel_addtensordeprecated) in the build phase.

- - Dynamic shape input: In the composition phase, because the shape is not fixed, each value in **tensor.dimensions** must be greater than **0** in the API calls to determine the shape input in the computing phase. When setting the shape, you can modify only the dimension whose value is **-1**. Assume that **[-1, 224, 224, 3]** is input as the the dimension of A in the composition phase. When this API is called, you can only change the size of the first dimension, for example, to [3, 224, 224, 3]. If other dimensions are adjusted, **OH_NN_INVALID_PARAMETER** is returned.

**Since**: 9

**Deprecated**: This API is deprecated since API version 11.

### OH_NNExecutor_SetOutput()<sup>(deprecated)</sup>

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNExecutor_SetOutput (OH_NNExecutor *executor, uint32_t outputIndex, void *dataBuffer, size_t length )
```

**Description**

Sets the memory for a single model output.

This method binds the buffer pointed by **dataBuffer** to the output specified by **outputIndex**. The length of the buffer is specified by **length**.

After [OH_NNExecutor_Run](#oh_nnexecutor_rundeprecated) is called to complete a single model inference, NNRt compares the length of the buffer pointed by **dataBuffer** with the length of the output data and returns different results based on the actual situation. 

- If the memory size is greater than or equal to the data length, the API copies the inference result to the memory and returns **OH_NN_SUCCESS**. You can read the inference result from **dataBuffer**.

- If the memory size is less than the data length, this API returns the error code **OH_NN_INVALID_PARAMETER** and generates a log indicating that the memory size is too small.

**Since**: 9

**Deprecated**: This API is deprecated since API version 11.

**Substitute**: [OH_NNExecutor_RunSync()](#oh_nnexecutor_runsync) is recommended.

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| executor | Pointer to the [OH_NNExecutor](#oh_nnexecutor) instance.|
| outputIndex | Output index value, which is the same as the sequence of the output data when [OH_NNModel_SpecifyInputsAndOutputs](#oh_nnmodel_specifyinputsandoutputs) is called. Assume that **outputIndices** is **{4, 6, 8}** when [OH_NNModel_SpecifyInputsAndOutputs](#oh_nnmodel_specifyinputsandoutputs) is called. When you set the output memory, set the value of this parameter to **{0, 1, 2}**.|
| dataBuffer | Pointer to the output data.|
| length | Length of the data memory, in bytes.|

**Returns**

Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, **OH_NN_SUCCESS** is returned. If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see [OH_NN_ReturnCode](#oh_nn_returncode).

```

**Description**

Adds an operator to a model instance.

You can use this API to add an operator to a model instance. The operator type is specified by **op**, and the operator parameters, inputs, and outputs are specified by **paramIndices**, **inputIndices**, and **outputIndices** respectively. This API verifies the attributes of operator parameters and the number of input and output parameters. These attributes must be correctly set when [OH_NNModel_AddTensorToModel](#oh_nnmodel_addtensortomodel) is called to add tensors. For details about the expected parameters, input attributes, and output attributes of each operator, see [OH_NN_OperationType](#oh_nn_operationtype).

**paramIndices**, **inputIndices**, and **outputIndices** store index values of tensors. Index values are determined by the sequence in which tensors are added to the model. For details about how to add a tensor, see [OH_NNModel_AddTensorToModel](#oh_nnmodel_addtensortomodel).

If unnecessary parameters are added for adding an operator, this API returns the error code **OH_NN_INVALID_PARAMETER**. If no operator parameter is set, the operator uses the default parameter value. For details about the default values, see [OH_NN_OperationType](#oh_nn_operationtype).

```
OH_NN_ReturnCode OH_NNModel_AddTensor (OH_NNModel *model, const OH_NN_Tensor *tensor )
```

**Description**

Adds a tensor to a model instance.

The data node and operator parameters in the NNRt model are composed of tensors of the model. You can use this API to add tensors to a model instance based on the **tensor** parameter.

```

**Description**

Creates an [NN_Tensor](#nn_tensor) instance based on the specified memory size and [NN_TensorDesc](#nn_tensordesc) instance.

This API uses **size** as the number of bytes of tensor data and allocates device memory to it. The device driver directly obtains tensor data in zero-copy mode.

Note that this API copies **tensorDesc** to [NN_Tensor](#nn_tensor). Therefore, if **tensorDesc** is no longer needed, destroy it by calling [OH_NNTensorDesc_Destroy](#oh_nntensordesc_destroy).

**deviceID** indicates the ID of the selected device. If the value is **0**, the first device is used.

**tensorDesc** is mandatory. If it is a null pointer, an error code is returned. The value of **size** must be greater than or equal to the number of bytes occupied by **tensorDesc**, which can be obtained by calling [OH_NNTensorDesc_GetByteSize](#oh_nntensordesc_getbytesize). Otherwise, an error code is returned. If the tensor shape is dynamic, **size** is not checked.

```

**Description**

Obtains the memory address of [NN_Tensor](#nn_tensor) data.

You can read/write data from/to tensor data memory. The data memory is mapped from the shared memory on the device. Therefore, the device driver can directly obtain tensor data in zero-copy mode.

Note: Only tensor data in the [offset, size) segment in the corresponding shared memory can be used. **offset** indicates the offset in the shared memory and can be obtained by calling [OH_NNTensor_GetOffset](#oh_nntensor_getoffset). **size** indicates the total size of the shared memory, which can be obtained by calling [OH_NNTensor_GetSize](#oh_nntensor_getsize).

If the **tensor** pointer is null, a null pointer is returned.

**Since**: 11

**Parameters**

| Name| Description|
| -------- | -------- |
| tensor | Pointer to the [NN_Tensor](#nn_tensor) instance.|

**Returns**

Pointer to the tensor data memory. If the operation fails, a null pointer is returned.
