# Application Development Overview

The application development documents provide reference for you to develop applications using the APIs provided by OpenHarmony. They walk you through how to use JavaScript APIs to develop applications on the standard system.

The documents are carefully organized as follows:

## Getting Started

[Here](quick-start/start-overview.md) you can learn how to better prepare yourself for application development.

In this part, you will learn the application package structure, resource file usage, and core functions and syntax of ArkTS. You can even build your first OpenHarmony application with simple operations. All these lay a foundation for your subsequent development.

## Development

To facilitate your application development, we provide development guidelines for key features.

First, familiarize yourself with the two cornerstone frameworks in OpenHarmony applications:

- Application framework: [Application Models](application-models/application-model-composition.md)
- UI framework: [UI Development](ui/arkui-overview.md)

All applications should be developed on top of these frameworks.

Then, equip yourself for developing the key features, with the following guidelines:

- [ArkTS Common Library](arkts-utils/arkts-commonlibrary-overview.md)
- [Web](web/web-component-overview.md)
- [Notification](notification/notification-overview.md)
- [Window Manager](windowmanager/window-overview.md)
- [WebGL](webgl/webgl-overview.md)
- [Media](media/media-application-overview.md)
- [Security](security/AccessToken/access-token-overview.md)
- [AI](ai/ai-overview.md)
- [Connectivity](connectivity/ipc-rpc-overview.md)
- [Telephony Service](telephony/telephony-overview.md)
- [Data Management](database/data-mgmt-overview.md)
- [File Management](file-management/core-file-kit-intro.md)
- [Background Task Management](task-management/background-task-overview.md)
- [Device Management](device/usb-overview.md)
- [Device Usage Statistics](device-usage-statistics/device-usage-statistics-overview.md)
- [DFX](dfx/hiappevent-guidelines.md)
- [Internationalization](internationalization/i18n-l10n.md)
- [Application Test](application-test/arkxtest-guidelines.md)
- [IDL Specifications and User Guide](IDL/idl-guidelines.md)
- [Using Native APIs in Application Projects](napi/napi-guidelines.md)

## Tools

DevEco Studio is a high-performance integrated development environment (IDE) recommended for developing OpenHarmony applications.
[Here](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/ohos-deveco-studio-overview-0000001263280421) you can learn everything about DevEco Studio, including how to use this tool to create a project and sign, debug, and run an application.

## Hands-On Tutorials

To make you better understand how functions work together and jumpstart your application development projects, we provide stripped-down, real-world [samples](https://gitee.com/openharmony/applications_app_samples/blob/master/README.md) and [codelabs](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/blob/master/README.md).

## API References

[API References](reference/development-intro.md) encompass all components and APIs provided by every kit in the OpenHarmony SDK, helping you use and integrate APIs more effectively.
