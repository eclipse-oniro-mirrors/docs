# Sensor Overview


Sensors in OpenHarmony are an abstraction of underlying sensor hardware. Your application can access the underlying sensor hardware via the sensors. Using the [Sensor](../reference/apis/js-apis-sensor.md) APIs, you can query sensors on your device, subscribe to sensor data, customize algorithms based on sensor data, and develop various sensor-based applications, such as compass, motion-controlled games, and fitness and health applications.

## Working Principles

The following modules work cooperatively to implement OpenHarmony sensors: Sensor API, Sensor Framework, Sensor Service, and HDF layer.

  **Figure 1** How the sensor works

![fad1a124-a90e-460f-84fc-e87d6caebb21](figures/fad1a124-a90e-460f-84fc-e87d6caebb21.png)

- Sensor API: provides APIs for performing basic operations on sensors, including querying the sensor list, subscribing to or unsubscribing from sensor data, and executing control commands. This module makes application development simpler.

- Sensor Framework: manages sensor data subscription, creates and destroys data channels, subscribes to or unsubscribes from sensor data, and implements communication with the Sensor Service module.

- Sensor Service: interacts with the HD_IDL module to receive, parse, and distribute data, manages foreground and background policies and sensors of a device, and controls sensor permissions.

- HDF layer: selects proper policies based on the hardware first in first out (FIFO) and frequency, and adapts to different devices.


## Constraints

1. To obtain data of the following sensors, you must claim the required permissions.

    | Sensor                      | Permission                             | Sensitivity        | Permission Description                   |
    | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
    | Acceleration sensor, uncalibrated acceleration sensor, and linear acceleration sensor| ohos.permission.ACCELEROMETER    | system_grant | Allows an application to subscribe to data of these acceleration-related sensors in the motion category.|
    | Gyroscope sensor and uncalibrated gyroscope sensor         | ohos.permission.GYROSCOPE        | system_grant | Allows an application to subscribe to data of the gyroscope-related sensors in the motion category.|
    | Pedometer sensor                      | ohos.permission.ACTIVITY_MOTION  | user_grant   | Allows an application to subscribe to the motion status.               |
    | Heart rate sensor                      | ohos.permission.READ_HEALTH_DATA | user_grant   | Allows an application to read health data.               |
    
2. The APIs for subscribing to and unsubscribing from sensor data work in pairs. If you do not need sensor data, call the unsubscription API to stop sensor data reporting.
