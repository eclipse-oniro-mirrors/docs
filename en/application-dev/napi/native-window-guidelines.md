# Native Window Development

## When to Use

Native Window is a local platform-based window that represents the producer of a graphics queue. It provides APIs for you to request and flush a buffer and configure buffer attributes.

The following scenarios are common for NativeWindow development:

* Request a graphics buffer by using the native API provided by **NativeWindow**, write the produced graphics content to the buffer, and flush the buffer to the graphics queue.
* Request and flush a buffer when adapting to the **eglswapbuffer** interface at the EGL.

## Available APIs

| API| Description| 
| -------- | -------- |
| OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowRequestBuffer (OHNativeWindow \*window, OHNativeWindowBuffer \*\*buffer, int \*fenceFd) | Requests an **OHNativeWindowBuffer** through an **OHNativeWindow** instance for content production.| 
| OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowFlushBuffer (OHNativeWindow \*window, OHNativeWindowBuffer \*buffer, int fenceFd, Region region) | Flushes the **OHNativeWindowBuffer** filled with the content to the buffer queue through an **OHNativeWindow** instance for content consumption.| 
| OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowHandleOpt (OHNativeWindow \*window, int code,...) | Sets or obtains the attributes of an **OHNativeWindow**, including the width, height, and content format.| 

For details about the APIs, see [native_window](../reference/native-apis/_native_window.md).

## How to Develop

The following describes how to use the native APIs provided by **NativeWindow** to request a graphics buffer, write the produced graphics content to the buffer, and flush the buffer to the graphics queue.

**Adding Dynamic Link Libraries**

Add the following libraries to **CMakeLists.txt**:
```txt
libace_ndk.z.so
libnative_window.so
```

**Header File**
```c++
#include <ace/xcomponent/native_interface_xcomponent.h>
#include <native_window/external_window.h>
```

1. Obtain an **OHNativeWindow** instance.

    You can call the APIs provided by [OH_NativeXComponent_Callback](../reference/native-apis/_o_h___native_x_component___callback.md) to obtain an **OHNativeWindow** instance. An example code snippet is provided below. For details about how to use the **\<XComponent>**, see [XComponent](../ui/arkts-common-components-xcomponent.md).
    1. Add an **\<XComponent>** to the .ets file.
        ```ts
        XComponent({ id: 'xcomponentId', type: 'surface', libraryname: 'entry'})
            .width(360)
            .height(360)
        ```
    2. Obtain **NativeXComponent** at the native C++ layer.
        ```c++
        napi_value exportInstance = nullptr;
        // Parse the attribute of the wrapped NativeXComponent pointer.
        napi_get_named_property(env, exports, OH_NATIVE_XCOMPONENT_OBJ, &exportInstance);
        OH_NativeXComponent *nativeXComponent = nullptr;
        // Use the napi_unwrap API to parse the NativeXComponent instance pointer.
        napi_unwrap(env, exportInstance, reinterpret_cast<void**>(&nativeXComponent));
        // Obtain the XComponent ID.
        char idStr[OH_XCOMPONENT_ID_LEN_MAX + 1] = {};
        uint64_t idSize = OH_XCOMPONENT_ID_LEN_MAX + 1;
        OH_NativeXComponent_GetXComponentId(nativeXComponent, idStr, &idSize);
        ```
    3. Define **OH_NativeXComponent_Callback**.
        ```c++
        // Define the callback.
        void OnSurfaceCreatedCB(OH_NativeXComponent* component, void* window)
        {
            // Obtain an OHNativeWindow instance.
            OHNativeWindow* nativeWindow = static_cast<OHNativeWindow*>(window);
            // ...
        }
        void OnSurfaceChangedCB(OH_NativeXComponent* component, void* window)
        {
            // Obtain an OHNativeWindow instance.
            OHNativeWindow* nativeWindow = static_cast<OHNativeWindow*>(window);
            // ...
        }
        void OnSurfaceDestroyedCB(OH_NativeXComponent* component, void* window)
        {
            // Obtain an OHNativeWindow instance.
            OHNativeWindow* nativeWindow = static_cast<OHNativeWindow*>(window);
            // ...
        }
        void DispatchTouchEventCB(OH_NativeXComponent* component, void* window)
        {
            // Obtain an OHNativeWindow instance.
            OHNativeWindow* nativeWindow = static_cast<OHNativeWindow*>(window);
            // ...
        }
        ```
        ```c++
        // Initialize OH_NativeXComponent_Callback.
        OH_NativeXComponent_Callback callback;
        callback.OnSurfaceCreated = OnSurfaceCreatedCB;
        callback.OnSurfaceChanged = OnSurfaceChangedCB;
        callback.OnSurfaceDestroyed = OnSurfaceDestroyedCB;
        callback.DispatchTouchEvent = DispatchTouchEventCB;
        ```
   4. Register **OH_NativeXComponent_Callback** with **NativeXComponent**.
        ```c++
        // Register the callback.
        OH_NativeXComponent_RegisterCallback(nativeXComponent, &callback);
        ```

2. Set the attributes of an **OHNativeWindowBuffer** by using **OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowHandleOpt**.
    ```c++
    // Set the width and height of the OHNativeWindowBuffer.
    int32_t code = SET_BUFFER_GEOMETRY;
    int32_t width = 0x100;
    int32_t height = 0x100;
    // The nativeWindow instance is obtained from the callback in the previous step.
    int32_t ret = OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowHandleOpt(nativeWindow, code, width, height);
    ```

3. Request an **OHNativeWindowBuffer** from the graphics queue.
    ```c++
    OHNativeWindowBuffer* buffer = nullptr;
    int fenceFd;
    // Obtain the OHNativeWindowBuffer instance by calling OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowRequestBuffer.
    OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowRequestBuffer(nativeWindow, &buffer, &fenceFd);
    // Obtain the buffer handle by calling OH_NativeWindow_GetBufferHandleFromNative.
    BufferHandle* bufferHandle = OH_NativeWindow_GetBufferHandleFromNative(buffer);
    ```

4. Map memory.
    ```c++
    #include <sys/mman.h>

    // Use mmap() to map the shared memory corresponding to the buffer handle to the user space. Image data can be written to the buffer handle by using the mapped virtual address.
    // bufferHandle->virAddr indicates the start address of the buffer handle in the shared memory, and bufferHandle->size indicates the memory usage of the buffer handle in the shared memory.
    void* mappedAddr = mmap(bufferHandle->virAddr, bufferHandle->size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, bufferHandle->fd, 0);
    if (mappedAddr == MAP_FAILED) {
        // mmap failed
    }
    ```

5. Write the produced content to the **OHNativeWindowBuffer**.
    ```c++
    static uint32_t value = 0x00;
    value++;
    uint32_t *pixel = static_cast<uint32_t *>(mappedAddr); // Use the address obtained by mmap() to access the memory.
    for (uint32_t x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        for (uint32_t y = 0;  y < height; y++) {
            *pixel++ = value;
        }
    }
    ```

5. Flush the **OHNativeWindowBuffer** to the graphics queue.
    ```c++
    // Set the refresh region. If Rect in Region is a null pointer or rectNumber is 0, all contents in the OHNativeWindowBuffer are changed.
    Region region{nullptr, 0};
    // Flush the buffer to the consumer through OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowFlushBuffer, for example, by displaying it on the screen.
    OH_NativeWindow_NativeWindowFlushBuffer(nativeWindow, buffer, fenceFd, region);
    ```
6. Unmap memory.
    ```c++
    // Unmap the memory when the memory is no longer required.
    int result = munmap(mappedAddr, bufferHandle->size);
    if (result == -1) {
        // munmap failed
    }
    ```
