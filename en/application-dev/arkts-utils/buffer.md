# Buffer Introduction

Based on the memory management mechanism, the buffer module abstracts the memory area into logical objects that can be read, written, and modified, aiming to provide efficient interfaces for binary data processing. Each buffer instance object is a continuous byte sequence. You can create memory blocks of a customized size to store and operate various types of data.

The core functions of the buffer module are as follows:

1. Memory creation and allocation: allows you to initialize the buffer based on the specified size limited by uint32. After the buffer is created, it has a fixed memory capacity.

2. Reads, writes, and copies data: accesses bytes in the buffer by index, reads and writes data by byte block, and copies a part of the buffer to another buffer or array.

3. Conversion operation: provides methods for converting between buffers and basic types (such as Uint8Array and string) to meet different data processing requirements.

4. Memory operation: The system can intercept some buffers, slice the buffers, and combine multiple buffers to facilitate data flow processing and management.

The buffer module is used in the following scenarios:

1. Big data transmission: When a large amount of data needs to be transmitted, such as binary files, database records, or network packets, the buffer functions as a data storage and processing container to reduce copy and memory consumption and improve transmission efficiency.

2. Image and audio processing: In terms of image encoding, decoding, and audio data stream processing, the buffer helps developers easily operate pixels or sample data to ensure data integrity.

3. Binary data operation: The buffer provides stable interfaces for parsing and operating binary data.
