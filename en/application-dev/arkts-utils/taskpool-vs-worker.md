# Comparison Between TaskPool and Worker


TaskPool and Worker provide a multithreaded runtime environment for applications, allowing them to handle time-consuming computing tasks or resource intensive tasks. This setup effectively prevents these tasks from blocking the host thread, maximizing resource utilization and improving overall system performance.


This topic compares TaskPool and Worker based on their implementation characteristics and suitable use cases.

## Use Case Comparison

Both TaskPool and Worker support multithreaded concurrency. However, TaskPool worker threads are bound to the system scheduling priority and support load balancing (automatic scaling), making it more efficient than Worker, which requires manual creation and may incur delays. In addition, Worker does not support scheduling priority setting. Therefore, TaskPool is recommended for most scenarios.

TaskPool is oriented to independent tasks, which are executed within threads. You do not need to care about the thread lifecycle, because long-running tasks (over 3 minutes and not classified as continuous tasks) are automatically reclaimed by the system. On the contrary, Worker is oriented to threads, supports long-running operations, and requires active lifecycle management.

Common use cases are as follows:

- Tasks exceeding 3 minutes: For tasks that run longer than 3 minutes (excluding time spent on Promise and async/await calls, such as network downloads and file I/O operations), use Worker. For example, use Worker for a background CPU-intensive prediction algorithm that runs for an hour. For details about the scenario example, see [Resident Task Development](./resident-task-guide.md).

- Associated synchronous tasks: In scenarios where a series of synchronous tasks is required, such as when creating and using handles that must be permanently stored, Worker is recommended to ensure proper management of these handles. For details, see [Using Worker for Interdependent Synchronous Tasks](./sync-task-development.md#using-worker-for-interdependent-synchronous-tasks).

- Tasks requiring priority setting: For example, in a Gallery histogram rendering scenario, background calculations for histogram data that affect user experience should be prioritized. This requires the use of TaskPool.

- Frequently canceled tasks: For tasks that need to be canceled often, such as in a Gallery viewing scenario where images on either side of the current image are cached, TaskPool is recommended to efficiently manage the cancellation of a cache task when swiping to the next image.

- Numerous or dispersed tasks: For applications with multiple modules containing numerous time-consuming tasks, using Worker for load management may be inconvenient. TaskPool is recommended in such cases. For details about the scenario example, see [Batch Database Operations](./batch-database-operations-guide.md).
