# ASON Parsing and Generation

The [ASON tool](../reference/apis-arkts/js-apis-arkts-utils.md#arktsutilsason) is similar to the JSON tool provided by JavaScript. JSON is used to stringify and parse JavaScript objects. ASON provides the serialization and deserialization capabilities of the [Sendable object](arkts-sendable.md). You can use the ASON.stringify method to convert an object into a string or use the ASON.parse method to convert a string into a Sendable object so that the object can be referenced and transferred between concurrent tasks with high performance.

> **Note**
>
> By default, the object generated by ASON.parse is a Sendable object. The layout cannot be changed, and attributes cannot be added or deleted. If the layout of the returned object needs to be variable, you can specify the return type as MAP. In this case, all [collections.Map](../reference/apis-arkts/js-apis-arkts-collections.md#collectionsmap) objects are returned. Attributes can be added or deleted.

## Samples

The interface provided by ASON is used to serialize and deserialize the [Sendable object](arkts-sendable.md).

```ts
import { ArkTSUtils, collections } from '@kit.ArkTS';

ArkTSUtils.ASON.parse("{}")
ArkTSUtils.ASON.stringify(new collections.Array(1, 2, 3))
```
