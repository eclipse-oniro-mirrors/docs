### Updating Source Code
- **Scenario**

  Update the OpenHarmony source code downloaded to the branch (for example, Master) source code.

- **Solution**

  1. Go to the OpenHarmony root directory.
  
     Check that the root directory has a **.repo** folder, which is usually hidden. If the **.repo** folder does not exist, decompress the obtained source code package again to obtain complete source code.
  
  2. Run the **repo init** command to initialize the source code repository information.

     In the command, *branch* indicates the branch name, for example, **master** or **OpenHarmony-3.2-Beta3**.
     ```shell
     repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b branch --no-repo-verify
     ```

  3. Download and update the source code file.

     ```shell
     repo sync -c
     repo forall -c 'pwd;git lfs pull'
     ```
     To keep the working directory clean, run the following command:
  
     >![icon-note.gif](public_sys-resources/icon-caution.gif) **CAUTION**<br>
     >This command will reset the local workspace and delete files or directories that are not managed by gitee. Exercise caution when performing this operation.
     ```shell
     repo forall -c 'git reset --hard;git clean -fdx'
     ```

  4. Run the prebuilts script to install the compiler and binary tool.

     ```shell
     bash build/prebuilts_download.sh
     ```
