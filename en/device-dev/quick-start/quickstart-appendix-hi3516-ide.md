> **Since OpenHarmony 3.2, the standard system does not perform adaptation verification for the Hi3516D V300 development board. You are advised to use RK3568 to develop standard-system devices.**
>
> **If you still use Hi3516DV300 to develop standard-system devices, adaptation may fail. Contact the chip supplier to obtain the adaptation guide and complete adaptation by yourself.**

In addition to the small system, the Hi3516DV300 development board also supports the standard system. This topic describes how to develop the standard system on Hi3516DV300 by using DevEco Device Tool.


The following exemplifies how to run the first program on the development board. This program displays the message "Hello World!" .


Before development, complete the following preparations:


- [Setting Up the Development Environment](quickstart-ide-env-win.md)

- [Creating a Project and Obtaining Source Code](quickstart-ide-import-project.md)


## Writing a Hello World Program


### Example Directory


```
applications/sample/hello
 │── BUILD.gn
 │── include
 │   └── helloworld.h
 │── src
 │   └── helloworld.c
 ├── bundle.json
 build
 └── subsystem_config.json
 productdefine/common
 └── products 
     └── Hi3516DV300.json
```


### How to Develop

Perform the steps below in the source code directory:

1. Create a directory and write the service code.
   
   Create the **applications/sample/hello/src/helloworld.c** directory and file whose code is shown in the following example. You can customize the content to be printed. For example, you can change **World** to **OHOS**. Declare the string printing function **HelloPrint** in the **helloworld.h** file. You can use either C or C++ to develop a program.


   ```
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include "helloworld.h"
   int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
       HelloPrint();
       return 0;
   }
   void HelloPrint()
   {
       printf("\n\n");
       printf("\n\t\tHello World!\n");
       printf("\n\n");
   }
   ```

   Add the header file **applications/sample/hello/include/helloworld.h**. The sample code is as follows:


   ```
   #ifndef HELLOWORLD_H
   #define HELLOWORLD_H
   #ifdef __cplusplus
   #if __cplusplus
   extern "C" {
   #endif
   #endif
   void HelloPrint();
   #ifdef __cplusplus
   #if __cplusplus
   }
   #endif
   #endif
   #endif // HELLOWORLD_H
   ```

2. Create a build file.
   1. Create the **applications/sample/hello/BUILD.gn** file. The file content is as follows:
      
       ```
       import("//build/ohos.gni") # Import the build template.
       ohos_executable("helloworld") {# Executable module.
         sources = [       # Source code of the module.
           "src/helloworld.c"
         ]
         include_dirs = [  # Directory of header files on which the module depends.
           "include" 
         ]
         cflags = []
         cflags_c = []
         cflags_cc = []
         ldflags = []
         configs = []
         deps =[]    # Internal dependencies of the component.
         part_name = "hello"    # Component name. This parameter is mandatory.
         install_enable = true # Whether to install the software by default. This parameter is optional. By default, the software is not installed.
       }
       ```
   2. Create the **applications/sample/hello/bundle.json** file and add the description of the **sample** component. The content is as follows:
      
       ```
       {
           "name": "@ohos/hello",
           "description": "Hello world example.",
           "version": "3.1",
           "license": "Apache License 2.0",
           "publishAs": "code-segment",
           "segment": {
               "destPath": "applications/sample/hello"
           },
           "dirs": {},
           "scripts": {},
           "component": {
               "name": "hello",
               "subsystem": "sample",
               "syscap": [],
               "features": [],
               "adapted_system_type": [ "mini", "small", "standard" ],
               "rom": "10KB",
               "ram": "10KB",
               "deps": {
                   "components": [],
                   "third_party": []
               },
               "build": {
                   "sub_component": [
                       "//applications/sample/hello:helloworld"
                   ],
                   "inner_kits": [],
                   "test": []
               }
           }
       }
       ```

       The **bundle.json** file consists of two parts. The first part describes the information about the subsystem to which the component belongs, and the second part defines the build configuration for the component. When adding a component, you must specify the **sub_component** of the component. If there are APIs provided for other components, add them in **inner_kits**. If there are test cases, add them in **test**.

3. Modify the subsystem configuration file.

   Add the configuration of the new subsystem to the **build/subsystem_config.json** file.


   ```
   "sample": {
       "path": "applications/sample/hello",
       "name": "sample"
     },
   ```

4. Modify the product configuration file.

   In the **productdefine/common/products/Hi3516DV300.json** file, add the **hello** part after the existing part.

   > ![icon-note.gif](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**
   >
   > In this example, the OpenHarmony-v3.1-Release version is used, where the Hi3516 configuration file is **productdefine/common/products/Hi3516DV300.json**. In OpenHarmony-v3.2-Beta2 and later versions, the Hi3516 configuration file is **vendor/hisilicon/Hi3516DV300/config.json**.


   ```
       "usb:usb_manager_native":{},
       "applications:prebuilt_hap":{},
       "sample:hello":{},
       "wpa_supplicant-2.9:wpa_supplicant-2.9":{},
   ```


## Building Source Code

   After the compilation is complete, go to the **out** directory of the project to view the generated files and perform burning operations.


## Burning an Image

Burning is the process of downloading compiled program files to a development board to provide a basis for subsequent debugging. With the one-click burning function of DevEco Device Tool, you can burn images on development boards quickly and efficiently.

The images of Hi3516DV300 are burnt in the Windows environment. After burning is initiated, DevEco Device Tool copies the target program files generated in the Ubuntu environment to the specified Windows directory in remote mode, and then burns the program files to Hi3516DV300 using the Windows burning tool.

Hi3516DV300 supports burning for the standard system through the USB port and network port. This topic describes how to burn source code through the USB port.


### Prerequisites

- The serial port driver has been installed on Hi3516DV300. For details, see [Installing the Serial Port Driver on the Hi3516D V300 Development Board](https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/guide/hi3516_hi3518-drivers-0000001050743695).

- The USB port driver has been installed on Hi3516DV300. For details, see [Installing the USB Port Driver on the Hi3516D V300 Development Board](https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/guide/usb_driver-0000001058690393).
