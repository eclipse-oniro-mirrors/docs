## Running a Hello World Program

1. When the system is running, start the serial port tool (for example, PuTTY), set the baud rate to **1500000**, and connect to the device.

2. Enable the serial port, enter the **helloworld** command in any directory (for example, the root directory of the device) and press **Enter**. If the message "Hello World!" is displayed, the program runs successfully.
