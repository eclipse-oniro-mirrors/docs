# Screen and Camera Control Overview<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001055101239"></a>

This document describes how to use the IoT camera development board \(Hi3516D V300\) and its camera and screen to implement photographing, video recording, and video preview.

This document helps you take a deep dive into OpenHarmony camera control. With this reference, you can develop devices, such as peephole cameras, smart rear-view mirrors, and smart displays.

If you want to view the running effect first, see [Use Case](device-camera-control-example.md). To customize application behavior, modify the sample code by referring to APIs described in the "Development Guidelines" section.
