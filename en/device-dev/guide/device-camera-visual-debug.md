# Debugging and Packaging<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001055527640"></a>

After the code is compiled, debug your application and package it into an App Pack. For details about how to debug and package an application, see  [Debugging Your App](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/ide_debug_device-0000001053822404)  and  [Building Your App](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/build_overview-0000001055075201)  in the  [HUAWEI DevEco Studio User Guide](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/tools_overview-0000001053582387). Currently, IPCamera applications do not support signature. You should release an unsigned App Pack.
