# Service Management
## Overview

Service management is implemented by using the init process to parse the service process configuration files (**xxx.cfg** files), which are used to configure services based on service scenarios. Currently, the supported value-added services include startup control, on-demand startup, command execution, scheduled startup, FD proxy, and sandbox management.

## Description of Service Process Configuration Files

- Naming:

    Generally, the configuration file is named in the format of **serviceName.cfg**, where **serviceName** is the service process name, for example, **appspawn.cfg**.

- Format:

    The configuration file is based on the JSON format and complies with the basic rules of the JSON file.

- Content:

    The configuration file contains the following fields. Except mandatory fields, other fields can be configured based on service features.

   Table 1 Service configuration fields

   | Field| Configuration|Supported System Type| Description| Remarks|
   | ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------| --------|

  - init service startup control (for standard system or higher)<a name = "section56901555918">

    The init process classifies services into three types based on service configurations and starts the services in different phases.

    - **boot**: services that need to be preferentially started in the system. This type of services are started in the init phase.
    - **normal**: common services in the system. This type of services are started in the post-init phase. This is the default service type.
    - **condition**: services that are started by running the startup command. You can add the **start xxxx** command to **jobs** to start the corresponding service.

  - init service command execution (for standard system or higher)<a name="section56901555919"></a>

    The init module provides the service command execution function, which allows services to execute different commands in different phases.

    - **on-start**: execution of commands after the service process is forked. The on-start job is executed in the subprocess of the service and affects only the subprocess.
    - **on-stop**: execution of commands in the init process when the service is stopped.
    - **on-restart**: execution of commands in the init process when the service is restarted.

    Configure the parameters as follows:
    ```
    "services" : [{
          "name" : "serviceName",
          "path" : ["/system/bin/serviceName"]
          "jobs" : {
              "on-boot" : "boot",
              "on-start" : "services:serviceName_start",
              "on-stop" : "services:serviceName_stop",
              "on-restart" : "services:serviceName_restart"
        }
    },
    ```
  
  With the parallel startup and command execution capabilities, processes can be started concurrently.
  
  - init service on-demand startup<a name="section56901555920">

    If on-demand startup is enabled, the init process starts a service only when it is required. The **ondemand** attribute is used to determine whether to enable on-demand startup for a service.

    The following is an example configuration of the **ondemand** attribute:
    ```
      "services" : [{
        "name" : "serviceName",
        "path" : ["/system/bin/serviceName"]
        "ondemand" : true
    }]
    ```
  - SA process on-demand startup

      For details, see [samgr Usage](https://gitee.com/openharmony/systemabilitymgr_samgr/blob/master/README.md).
      
  - Socket process on-demand startup
      1. The init process creates a socket for socket processes in the pre-fork phase and listens to read/write events on this socket.
      2. If a read/write event is received over the socket, the init process starts the native service corresponding to the socket process, cancels event listening on the socket, and transfers the socket to the corresponding native service for management.
      3. The native service automatically exits if no more packets need to be processed. When reclaiming subprocesses, the init process starts event listening over the socket again based on the service configuration.

  - Hot-swap service process on-demand startup

    The hot-swap service process can be started to process hot swap events based on system parameter changes.

  - Enhanced init process startup and recycling

    The CPU core binding, priority, MAC address, and AccessToken information of the service process can be configured in the configuration file during process startup.

    - Support of CPU core binding for service processes (through modification of the **.cfg** file)
    - Support of priority setting for service processes (through modification of the **.cfg** file)
    - Support of MAC address setting (that is, SELinux tag setting) for service processes (through modification of the **.cfg** file)
    - Support of AccessToken setting for service processes and distributed capability setting for system service processes (through modification of the **.cfg** file)
    - Support of the suppression mechanism for service processes (through modification of the **.cfg** file)

    The following is the example configuration for enhanced init process startup and recycling:
      ```
      "services" : [{
          "name" : "serviceName",
          "path" : ["/system/bin/serviceName"]
          "importance" : 1,                  // Priority for service processes
          "cpucore" : [0],                   // CPU binding for service processes
          "critical" : [1, 5, 10],           // Suppression for service processes
          "apl" : "normal",                  // Ability privilege level for service processes
          "d-caps" : ["OHOS_DMS"],           // Distributed capabilities for service processes
          "secon" : "u:r:distributedsche:s0" // SELinux tag for service processes. In this example, the SELinux tag is u:r:distributedsche:s0.
      }
      ```
  
  - Scheduled startup

    Scheduled startup means to start a service at the specified time. If the service has been started, it will not be started again. For details about the command, see [Description of begetctl Commands](subsys-boot-init-plugin.md).
    ```
    timer_start servicename timeout
    ```
## Basic Process of Creating a Service Process

### Configuring the Service Process Configuration File

  After finishing the service process code, create the **serviceName.cfg** file (**serviceName** indicates the service process name) and configure the file content based on service features.

  Install the configuration file in the corresponding directory. Configure the **/base/startup/init/services/etc/BUILD.gn** file of the init module as follows:

  ```
  ohos_prebuilt_etc("watchdog.cfg") {
    source = "//base/startup/init/services/etc/watchdog.cfg"
    relative_install_dir = "init"
    part_name = "init"
    subsystem_name = "startup"
  }

  ohos_prebuilt_etc("console.cfg") {
    source = "//base/startup/init/services/etc/console.cfg"
    relative_install_dir = "init"
    part_name = "init"
    subsystem_name = "startup"
  }

  ```

  Add the build path of the configuration file to the **bundle.json** file of the corresponding module. For example:

  ```
      "build": {
          "group_type": {
              "base_group": [],
              "fwk_group": [],
              "service_group": [
                  "//base/startup/init/ueventd:startup_ueventd",
                  "//base/startup/init/services/etc:ueventd.cfg"
              ]
            },
      }
  ```
### Configuring the DAC Permission for a Service Process

  Configure the DAC permission for the desired service process based on the GID and UID in the service process configuration file.

  If the corresponding GID and UID do not exist, add them to the **/init/services/etc/passwd** and **/init/services/etc/group** files of the init module.

  - Description of the **passwd** file:

  - Each entry corresponds to a user. User information is separated by colons (:) and divided into seven fields, as shown below:

    ```js
    root:x:0:0:::/bin/false
    bin:x:2:2:::/bin/false
    system:x:1000:1000:::/bin/false
    ```

  Fields in the **passwd** file
  |     SN  |   Field   |                            Description                             |
  | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 1| User name   | Use a name that is easy to remember, for example, **root**. Based on the mapping between user names and user ID (UIDs), the system identifies a user and grants the required user permissions.|
  | 2| Password flag     | **x** indicates that a password has bee set, but not the real password. The real password is stored in the **/etc/shadow** file.|
  | 3| UID       | Each user has a unique UID. The system identifies a user based on the UID.<br>A valid UID ranges from 0 to 65535. Numbers in different ranges represent different UIDs.<br>1. 0: administrator<br>2. 1 to 499: system users<br>3. 500 to 65535: common users|
  | 4| GID       | A GID indicates an initial group. A user has the permissions of the initial group once logging in to the system. Each user can have only one initial group. Generally, the initial group has the same name as the user name.|
  | 5| Description | This field provides a simple description of the user. It is usually left blank.                                              |
  | 6| Home directory   | This field specifies the home directory of a user. For example, the home directory of the **root** user is **/root**. This field is usually left blank.                         |
  | 7| Default shell| Shell is a Linux command interpreter and serves as a bridge between users and the Linux kernel. It is used to convert commands entered by users into machine languages that can be identified by the system. By default, the command interpreter used by the Linux system is usually **/bin/bash**.|

  - Description of the **group** file

  - Each entry corresponds to a user group. User group information is separated by colons (:) and divided into four fields, as shown below:

    ```js
    root:x:0:
    bin:x:2:
    system:x:1000:
    servicectrl:x:1050:root,shell,system,samgr,hdf_devmgr,foundation,update
    ```

  Fields in the **group** file
  |    SN   | Field     |                         Description                      |
  | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1| Group name| This field indicates the user group name. For example, **servicectrl** indicates that the user group name is **servicectrl**.|
  | 2| Password flag| Similar to the **/etc/passwd** file, **x** is only the password flag. The encrypted group password is stored in the **/etc/gshdow** file.|
  | 3| GID | GIDs are used to identify different user groups.|
  | 4| Group member| This field indicates the members of a user group. For example, the members of the **servicectrl** group include **root**, **shell**, **system**, **samgr**, **hdf_devmgr**, **foundation**, and **update**.|

  - If the GID and UID are set to **root** or **system**, add a trustlist to the **security_config/high_privilege_process_list.json** file in the corresponding product directory. For example:

  ```
    {
        "high_privilege_process_list": [
            {
                "name": "appspawn",
                "uid": "root",
                "gid": "root"
            },
            {
                "name": "console",
                "uid": "root"
            },
            {
                "name": "testService",
                "uid": "root",
                "gid": "root"
            },
            {
                "name": "media_service",
                "gid": ["root", "system"]
            },
            {
                "name": "misc",
                "uid": "root",
                "gid": "root"
            } ... ...
        ]
    }

  ```
### Configuring the SELinux Permission for a Service Process

- Configuring the SELinux permission

  1. Check whether the service process can be started in permissive mode. If yes, you do not need to configure the **selinux** tag.

  2. To configure SELinux rules, you need to set the SELinux tag in the **secon** field in the configuration file of the service process.

  3. Define the service process tag in the SELinux module. The procedure is as follows:

  Define the tag for program execution in the **base/security/selinux_adapter/sepolicy/base/system/file_contexts** file. For example:

  ```
    /system/bin/watchdog_service        u:object_r:watchdog_service_exec:s0
    /system/bin/hdcd        u:object_r:hdcd_exec:s0
  ```

  Define the applicable scope of the tag in the **base/security/selinux_adapter/sepolicy/base/public/type.te** file. For example:

  ```
    type watchdog_service, sadomain, domain;
    type watchdog_service_exec, exec_attr, file_attr, system_file_attr;
  ```

| int StopServiceTimer(const char *serviceName)  | Stops a service timer.| Return value: **0** if the operation is successful; **-1** otherwise.<br> Parameters:<br> **serviceName**: service name.|

  - The service management APIs are privileged APIs. Therefore, you need to configure the DAC and SELinux permissions as follows:

   - Go to **/base/startup/init/services/etc/group** and add the correct user ID to **servicectrl**. For example:

    ```
    servicectrl:x:1050:root,shell,system,samgr,hdf_devmgr
    ```

  - SELinux configuration for service control APIs

    Add the required SELinux permissions to the **init.te** file. For example, grant the system parameter write permission for services such as **init**, **samgr**, and **hdf_devmgr**.

    ```java
    allow { init samgr hdf_devmgr } servicectrl_param:parameter_service { set };
    ```
## Constraints

The service management module is available only for the mini system and standard system.
