## Development Example

HiDumper helps you export basic system information to locate and analyze faults. Complex parameters passed to sub-services and abilities must be enclosed in double quotation marks.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Access the device CLI, and run the **hidumper -h** command to obtain the help information, which includes basic information and function syntax.
     
   ```
   hidumper -h
   ```

2. Run the **hidumper -lc** command to obtain the system information cluster list.
     
   ```
   hidumper -lc
   ```

3. Run the **hidumper -c** command to obtain all information that is classified by **base** and **system**.
     
   ```
   hidumper -c
   ```

4. Run the **hidumper -c [base | system]** to obtain the system cluster information that is classified by **base** or **system**.
     
   ```
   hidumper -c base
   hidumper -c system
   ```

5. Run the **hidumper -ls** command to obtain the system ability list.
     
   ```
   hidumper -ls
   ```

6. Run the **hidumper -s** command to obtain all system ability information.
     
   ```
   hidumper -s
   ```

7. Run the **hidumper -s 3301 -a "-h"** command to obtain the help information about the ability whose ID is **3301**.
     
   ```
   hidumper -s 3301 -a "-h"
   ```

8. Run the **hidumper -s 3008** command to obtain all information about the ability whose ID is **3008**.
     
   ```
   hidumper -s 3008
   ```

9. Run the **hidumper -e** command to obtain the crash information generated by the FaultLogger module.
     
   ```
   hidumper -e
   ```

10. Run the **hidumper --net** command to obtain network information.
     
    ```
    hidumper --net
    ```

11. Run the **hidumper --storage** command to obtain storage information.
     
    ```
    hidumper --storage
    ```

12. Run the **hidumper -p** command to obtain process information, including the list and information of processes and threads.
     
    ```
    hidumper -p
    ```

13. Run the **hidumper -p 1024** command to obtain information about the process whose PID is **1024**.
     
    ```
    hidumper -p 1024
    ```

14. Run the **hidumper  --cpuusage [pid]** command to obtain the CPU usage information. If the PID of a process is specified, only the CPU usage of the process is returned.
     
    ```
    hidumper --cpuusage
    hidumper --cpuusage 1024
    ```

15. Run the **hidumper --cpufreq** command to obtain the actual operating frequency of each CPU core.
     
    ```
    hidumper --cpufreq
    ```

16. Run the **hidumper --mem [pid]** command to obtain all memory usage information. If the PID of a process is specified, only the memory usage of the process is returned.
     
    ```
    hidumper --mem [pid]
    ```
    The following table describes the parameters in the first column of the command output when the PID of the process is specified.
    | Name            | Description|
    |----------------|----|
    | GL             | GPU memory.  |
    | Graph          | Graphics memory. |
    | ark ts heap    | Memory usage of the ArkTS heap. |
    | guard          | Memory occupied by the protection section.  |
    | native heap    | Heap memory.  |
    | AnonPage other | Memory occupied by other pages that are not mapped to files. |
    | stack          | Stack memory.  |
    | .hap           | Memory occupied by the application.  |
    | .db            | Memory occupied by the **.db** files loaded by processes.  |
    | .so            | Memory occupied by the **.so** dynamic library files loaded by processes.  |
    | .ttf           | Memory occupied by the **.ttf** font files loaded by processes.  |
    | dev            | Memory occupied by the files that are named with the **/dev** prefix and loaded by processes.  |
    | FilePage other | Memory occupied by other pages that are mapped to files.  |

17. Run the **hidumper --zip** command to compress data to the **/data/dumper** directory.
     
    ```
    hidumper --zip
    ```

18. Run the **hidumper -t timeout** command to set the timeout period, in seconds. The default value is **30**. Value **0** indicates no timeout limit.
     
    ```
    hidumper -t [timeout]
    ```
