# File Management

## Introduction

The file management subsystem provides a complete file management solution for OpenHarmony. It provides secure and easy-to-use file access and comprehensive file management capabilities, including:

- A sandbox to ensure the least privilege as well as application data security
- Unified management of user files and streamlined user data access and storage to ensure user data security and purity
- Access framework to allow applications to access distributed file system files and cloud files as they access local files
- Sharing of user data and system files across applications and devices
- System storage management capabilities and basic file system capabilities
