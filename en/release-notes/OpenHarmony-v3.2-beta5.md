# OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta5


## Version Description

OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta5 provides the following enhancements over OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta4:

**Enhanced basic capabilities for the standard system**

The startup performance of the WebView component is optimized. Configuration management and input event support capabilities are enhanced. JSON files can be imported and loaded in modular mode.

The task pool and the TS2AOT-tool of the host version are provided. The dynamic library of the HAP package can be loaded without being compressed. The compiler runtime supports shared packages in the same application.

The dynamic shared library can be installed, updated, uninstalled, packed, and unpacked. For an application that is not configured with an entry icon, a default icon is displayed on the home screen. The runtime capability of the HAR shared package can be verified.

The local database is changed for widgets. Protection against frequent restart is provided for applications. The ServiceExtensionAbility component supports the asynchronous **onConnected** lifecycle.

Binding and authentication between local accounts and domain accounts are supported. A basic framework is provided for domain account management services. Direct creation of local users is forbidden.

The capabilities for controlling power indicators and lights are provided.

The HDI driver display layer supports horizontal mirroring and vertical mirroring.

**Enhanced application development framework for the standard system**

The process of compiling the shared package is added to the toolchain.

ArkUI supports obtaining of resources by resource name.

The component supports multi-level menus and group menus.

The process of compiling the HAR package is added.

The HAP compilation process is adapted so that .d.ets declaration files can be identified during HAP compilation.

**Enhanced distributed capabilities for the standard system**

BLE connection parameters can be configured, and the connection process is optimized.

## Source Code Acquisition


### Prerequisites

1. Register your account with Gitee.

2. Register an SSH public key for access to Gitee.

3. Install the [git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [git-lfs](https://gitee.com/vcs-all-in-one/git-lfs?_from=gitee_search#downloading), and configure user information.
  
   ```
   git config --global user.name "yourname"
   git config --global user.email "your-email-address"
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

4. Run the following commands to install the **repo** tool:
  
   ```
   curl -s https://gitee.com/oschina/repo/raw/fork_flow/repo-py3 > /usr/local/bin/repo  # If you do not have the permission, download the tool to another directory and configure it as an environment variable by running the chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/repo command.
   pip3 install -i https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple requests
   ```


### Acquiring Source Code Using the repo Tool

**Method 1 (recommended)**

Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over SSH. (You must have an SSH public key for access to Gitee.)

- Obtain the source code from the version branch. You can obtain the latest source code of the version branch, which includes the code that has been incorporated into the branch up until the time you run the following commands:
   ```
   repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b OpenHarmony-3.2-Beta5 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.2-Beta5 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```

**Method 2**

Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over HTTPS.

- Obtain the source code from the version branch. You can obtain the latest source code of the version branch, which includes the code that has been incorporated into the branch up until the time you run the following commands:
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b OpenHarmony-3.2-Beta5 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.2-Beta5 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```

## Known Issues

**Table 6** Known issues

| Issue No.| Description| Impact| To Be Resolved By|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| I6ATXO | [RK3568] The execution result of the OpenGL test suite contains failed items during XTS test.| The test case used to test the OpenGL interface is not adapted after other modules of the system are changed. The modules or applications that use the OpenGL interface are not affected, and the risk is controllable.| 2023-02-05|
| I6B1IC | [RK3568] [Low probability 1/10] [XTS] The ispserver thread in the /vendor/bin/ispserver process causes a cpp crash in librkaiq.z.so.| In the pressure test, there is a low probability that the ipserver thread causes a cpp crash. The ipserver thread can be automatically restarted, and services are not affected.| 2023-02-05|
| I6BJ9Z<br>I6BJ82 | alloc_file_pseudo memory leakage occurs.| The accept4 reference count is unbalanced, causing memory leakage on selinux_netlbl_sock_genattr, new_inode_pseudo, and inet_create. No patch is available in the upstream community yet, and the issue will be resolved once a patch is released in the upstream community.| 2023-03-30|
| I641A2<br>I64726 | The Bluetooth module has silent pairing issues. Other devices can be completely controlled through the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse after silent pairing.| This issue will be resolved in the form of a requirement in later versions.| 2023-03-30|
| I6BRTS | Invoking the **rdb::executeSql** interface may cause memory leakage.| Memory leakage occurs when the **rdb::executeSql** interface is repeatedly called during initialization. This interface is called only during application initialization, and therefore the impact of memory leakage is controllable.| 2023-02-10|
| I6AZ4T | Memory leakage exists for applications with the **\<textInput>** component.| Memory leakage occurs when the **\<textInput>** component is repeatedly called at a high frequency. The root cause is that the memory is not reclaimed during the calling of the third-party library flutter. We will first check whether the problem is caused by the open-source flutter component.| 2023-02-10|
