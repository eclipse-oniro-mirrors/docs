# OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta3


## Version Description

OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta3 provides the following enhancements over OpenHarmony 3.2 Beta2:

**Enhanced basic capabilities for the standard system**

The pan-sensor subsystem adds vibrator priority management.

The multimodal input subsystem adds mouse pointer style and speed setting, configuration of sequential ability startup, and ScreenHop; and enhances mouse event reporting.

The Misc services subsystem adds the following basic features: pasteboard, upload and download, screen lock, and input method framework.

The kernel subsystem adds the following basic capabilities: memory level notification to Ability Manager Service (AMS), reclaim priority management for resident system services, and reclaim priority management based on different Extension ability states.

In the Design For X (DFX) subsystem, the faultloggerd component supports print in the hybrid JS and native stacks; the hilog component provides domain trustlist management and log statistics; the hisysevent and hiappeventssh components provide enhanced event capabilities; the hidumper component provides more detailed memory classification information.

The parameterized data driver capability is added to the unit test framework. APIs related to fling and complex gestures (such as two-finger pinch) are added to the UI test framework. The xdevice component adds device-level DFX log collection upon task execution.

The multi-language runtime subsystem adds the following capabilities: ES2021 in strict mode, modularization, runtime debugging and tuning enhancement, and bytecode hot reload.

User identity authentication is added to the IAM account subsystem. The permission service supports precise positioning and fuzzy positioning, and other capabilities are enhanced. The privacy management service is provided.

The multimedia subsystem adds native APIs for audio decoding, audio encoding, video decoding, and video encoding; audio and video synchronization; playback start time optimization; video hardware encoding and decoding based on the HDI codec interface; distributed audio, volume, and device status management; device listening and projection; preview, photographing, and video recording using distributed cameras.

**Enhanced application development framework for the standard system**

The common event and notification subsystem provides DLP adaptation. Subsystems can send notifications.

The webview component supports copy and paste. Basic audio/video playback and HTTPS bidirectional authentication are supported.

Permission verification, startup rules, and quick repair are added for the ability framework, and widgets can be flexibly separated and combined.

The following capabilities are enhanced: ArkUI component, resource and media query, DFX, and toolchain. The memory and performance are optimized.

The DeviceProfile subsystem supports adaptation to the automatic synchronization policy of the distributed database and supplements the type of information that can be collected.

For the bundle management framework, Extension abilities are added for the thumbnail and preview. Certain features become tailorable. Foolproof and quick repair are added. Specific capabilities of preset applications can be managed. Applications can be installed without decompressing HAP files.

For the system ability management subsystem (SAMGR), system services can be loaded across devices. The restart and recovery mechanism is provided for the foundation process. Distributed component management supports multi-user, cross-device invoking. Singleton ability continuation is supported.

**Enhanced distributed capabilities for the standard system**

The distributed database supports cross-device and cross-application sharing. The relational database (RDB) supports remote query, database encryption, and app twin. The KVDB supports backup and restore, condition-based synchronization, and centralized system data synchronization when the device goes online.

## Source Code Acquisition


### Prerequisites

1. Register your account with Gitee.

2. Register an SSH public key for access to Gitee.

3. Install the [git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [git-lfs](https://gitee.com/vcs-all-in-one/git-lfs?_from=gitee_search#downloading), and configure user information.
  
   ```
   git config --global user.name "yourname"
   git config --global user.email "your-email-address"
   git config --global credential.helper store

   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u git@gitee.com:openharmony/manifest.git -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.2-Beta3 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```

**Method 2**

Use the **repo** tool to download the source code over HTTPS.

- Obtain the source code from the version branch. You can obtain the latest source code of the version branch, which includes the code that has been incorporated into the branch up until the time you run the following commands:
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b OpenHarmony-3.2-Beta3 --no-repo-verify
   repo sync -c
   repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
   ```
   
- Obtain the source code from the version tag, which is the same as that released with the version.
   ```
   repo init -u https://gitee.com/openharmony/manifest -b refs/tags/OpenHarmony-v3.2-Beta3 --no-repo-verify

## Known Issues

  **Table 6** Known issues

| Issue No.| Description| Impact| To Be Resolved By|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| I59PWR | In the memory usage test performed on the RK3568 device, the actual value of the com.ohos.launcher process is 84279 KB, which exceeds the baseline value by 200 MB.| Though the process consumes more memory than what is expected, it does not affect the overall memory usage of the system.| October 20|
| I59QII | In the resident memory test performed on the RK3568 device, the actual value of the netmanager process is 3884 KB, which exceeds the baseline value (1241 KB) by 2.58 MB. In the memory test, the actual value of the netmanager process exceeds the baseline value (1241 KB) by 1 MB.| Though the process consumes more memory than what is expected, it does not affect the overall memory usage of the system.| October 20|
| I5LH57 | In the resident memory test performed on the RK3568 device, the actual value of the telephony process is 10329 KB, which exceeds the baseline value (8434 KB) by 1.85 MB.| Though the process consumes more memory than what is expected, it does not affect the overall memory usage of the system.| October 20|
| I5Q5PR | In the resident memory test performed on the RK3568 device, the actual value of the wifi_hal_service process is 4374 KB, which exceeds the baseline value (829 KB) by 3.4 MB.| The memory usage exceeds the expected value, but the memory usage of the entire system is not affected. The baseline value has been met, and no function is affected.| October 20|
| I5T71O | In the dynamic memory test performed on the RK3568 device, the actual value of the com.ohos.settings process is 76123 KB, which exceeds the baseline value (15824 KB) by 58.8 MB.| Though the process consumes more memory than what is expected, it does not affect the overall memory usage of the system.| October 20|
| I5S40B | The actual sliding frame rate of **Contacts** is 30.3 fps, which is less than the baseline value (54 fps) by 23.7 fps.| The load success rate is affected. This issue depends on the ArkUI framework reconstruction.| October 15|
| I5MVDK | A crash occurs when a socket fuzz test is performed on **/data/data/.pulse_dir/runtime/cli**.| The process crashes during the test.| October 18|
| I5M3UO | [TTE WRC team] There is new line injection via the Wi-Fi SSID in the wifi_manager_service.| If the Wi-Fi SSID contains invalid characters (\n), an exception occurs when saving or parsing the configuration file.| October 12|
| I5T8FV | The verification permission is not defined in the system and does not take effect.| The authentication fails. No process can request the permission. Currently, no service uses this permission.| October 18|
