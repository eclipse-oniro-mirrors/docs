      SERVICE = 3,
      ACCESSIBILITY = 4,
      DATA_SHARE = 5,
      FILE_SHARE = 6,
      STATIC_SUBSCRIBER = 7,
      WALLPAPER = 8,
      BACKUP = 9,
      WINDOW = 10,
      ENTERPRISE_ADMIN = 11,

## cl.bundlemanager.2 Struct BusinessAbilityInfo Moved from bundleManager to application

## cl.bundlemanager.3 Bottom-Layer Capability Changed

When the SDK of API version 9 or an earlier version is used to compile the HAP, the resource files of the HAP are decompressed after the HAP is installed.

When the SDK of API version 10 or a later version is used to compile the HAP, the resource files of the HAP are not decompressed after the HAP is installed.

**Change Impact**

If the SDK of API version 9 or earlier is used, no adaptation is required.

If the SDK of API version 10 or a later version is used and your application accesses resource files by combining paths, adaptation is required. If your application does not access resource files by combining paths, no adaptation is required.

**Key API/Component Changes**

**Adaptation Guide**

The resource management subsystem provides JavaScript APIs for accessing resource files. For details, see [Accessing Resource Files](../../../application-dev/reference/apis/js-apis-resource-manager.md#getrawfilecontent9).


## cl.bundlemanager.4 Changed distroFilter to distributionFilter in the module.json File
The [distroFilter](../../../application-dev/quick-start/module-configuration-file.md) tag in the **module.json** file is changed to **distributionFilter**.

**Change Impact**

This change is a compatible change. If the **distroFilter** tag is used, no error is reported during compilation on DevEco Studio, but a wavy line is displayed in the editor.

**Adaptation Guide**

Replace **distroFilter** with **distributionFilter** in the configuration file.
