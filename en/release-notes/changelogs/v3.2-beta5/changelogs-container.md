# Common Library Subsystem Changelog

## cl.commonlibrary.1 Error Code and Information Change
The error codes and information returned by APIs of the **ArrayList**, **List**, **LinkedList**, **Stack**, **Queue**, **Deque**, **PlainArray**, **LightWeightMap**, **LightWeightSet**, **HashMap**, **HashSet**, **TreeMap**, and **TreeSet** classes are changed.

For details about the changed error codes, see [Utils Error Codes](../../../application-dev/reference/errorcodes/errorcode-utils.md).

No adaptation is required for applications developed using these APIs.

**Key API/Component Changes**
Error code information is redefined for APIs in these classes and marked using **'@throws'** in the *.d.ts file of the corresponding module.
The sample code is as follows:
**ArrayList** class before the change:
constructor();
**ArrayList** class after the change:
@throws { BusinessError } 10200012 - The ArrayList's constructor cannot be directly invoked.
constructor();

**Change Impact**

No impact.
