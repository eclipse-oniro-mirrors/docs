| [Distributed Game Controller](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Distributed/HandleGameApplication)| This codelab shows how to develop a game controller in ArkTS. By leveraging the distributed capabilities, one development board is used as the game controller, and another development board is used as the game server. | ArkTS |
| [Distributed Jigsaw Puzzle](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Distributed/OpenHarmonyPictureGame)| This codelab shows how to develop a jigsaw puzzle. In this development, the RPC is used for cross-device communication, and **CommonEvent** is used to implement communication between the Service ability and FA.| ArkTS |
| [Distributed Control](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Distributed/RemoteControllerETS)| This codelab shows how to develop a distributed control in ArkTS. By leveraging the distributed capabilities, one development board is used as the TV, and another development board is used as the remote control. | ArkTS |
| [Audio Recording](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Media/Audio_OH_ETS)| This codelab shows how to use **AudioRecorder** to record an audio file and use **AudioPlayer** to play the recorded audio.| ArkTS |
| [Notepad](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Data/NotePad_OH_ETS)| This codelab shows how to develop a notepad in ArkTS. You can create, delete, and favorite notes, and use the lightweight database to store data persistently. | ArkTS |
| [Distributed Mail Editing](https://gitee.com/openharmony/codelabs/tree/master/Distributed/OHMailETS)| This codelab shows how to develop the distributed email editing function. By leveraging the distributed capabilities, a remote device in the same LAN and with the same login account can be started, and email editing can be continued on the remote device.| ArkTS |

| I4OLHF | [ArkUI subsystem] The test process is abnormal due to the com.amsst.amsMissionSnapshotTest process.|
| I4OLUK | [ArkUI subsystem] The process stack is abnormal due to the com.ohos.systemui process.|


## Known Issues

**Table 7** Known issues

| Issue No.| Description| Impact| To Be Resolved On|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [I4NRS5](https://gitee.com/openharmony/kernel_linux_5.10/issues/I4NRS5) | [Kernel subsystem] A CVE vulnerability exists.| No patch has been released for the Linux kernel. The kernel will be updated after the patch is released in the community.| Depending on the patch release in the community|
| [I4UUFR](https://gitee.com/openharmony/third_party_e2fsprogs/issues/I4UUFR) | Local image compilation and build may fail for the Hi3516 development board.| Compilation occasionally fails on the Hi3516 development board. This issue can be resolved by downloading the code.| 2022-04-30 |
| [I4RJU8](https://e.gitee.com/open_harmony/issues/list?issue=I4RJU8) | A black screen occurs during camera preview on the Hi3516 development board of a standard-system device.| The preview function is affected.| 2022-05-30 |
| [I4Z3G9](https://e.gitee.com/open_harmony/issues/list?issue=I4Z3G9) | [Graphics subsystem] [RK3568] Screen flickering occurs when the secondary window is opened in the immersive primary window.| User experience is adversely affected.| 2022-04-15 |
| [I50EBB](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/issues/I50EBB?from=project-issue) | [Hi3516 burning] Images of the Hi3516 development board on a standard-system device cannot be burnt by using the IDE.| The burning fails only in the Ubuntu environment of the IDE.<br>**Workaround**: Use the remote mode to burn the image on Windows.<br>**Solution**:<br>The Windows + Ubuntu hybrid mode will be used. Remote Ubuntu development, compilation, and debugging are performed on Windows, and burning is automatically performed on Windows.| 2022-04-30 |
