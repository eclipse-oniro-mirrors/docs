# OpenHarmony 5.0.0 Release


## Version Description

OpenHarmony 5.0.0 Release continuously improves its standard system capabilities. It provides the following enhancements over OpenHarmony 5.0 Beta1:

The application framework provides more lifecycle management capabilities and child process capabilities, allowing for more refined task scheduling and management during runtime. ArkUI further opens up the rendering capability of custom nodes. The bundle manager improves the efficiency of application packaging and enriches the operable scenarios when end users use applications (such as creating application clones and home screen shortcuts). Distributed data management is further enhanced for higher security while ensuring proper data sharing. Module adaptation to the sendable mechanism is also enhanced. The file manager further improves the picker capability to properly control and use file resources. The media playback and recording capabilities are further enhanced, with new support for multiple audio, video, and image encoding formats, along with more refined playback control operations. The camera provides more powerful capabilities, enriching the scenarios for end users to take photos.

Multiple subsystems have further aligned with ArkTS to enhance NDK C API capabilities, such as ArkUI's adaptability to third-party frameworks, Unified Data Management Framework (UDMF), graphics rendering, playback framework, camera, graphics codec, network management, internationalization, time and time zone, input method framework, and pasteboard.

A more detailed description of the enhancements is as follows:


### Application Framework

- You can create JS or native child processes for time-consuming operations.

- A wider range of lifecycle events, such as **onNewWant**, are provided for abilities.

- An ability can return the AbilityResult to the caller without proactively destroying itself.

- Context supports the conversion of sendable objects for passing the context in multithreading environments.

- Application-level font settings are supported.


### ArkUI

- Component customization is further enhanced with the introduction of **Modifier**, **ContentModifier**, and **DrawModifier**. Attributes can be added to existing components, component content can be customized, and fully custom rendering is supported.

- Custom nodes and native rendering nodes are opened up. [Custom nodes](https://gitee.com/OpenHarmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/ui/arkts-user-defined.md) are node objects with some basic capabilities of underlying entity nodes. They can be mixed and displayed with built-in components through custom placeholder nodes. They have customization capabilities for individual nodes, such as measurement and layout, setting basic attributes, setting event listeners, and custom drawing and rendering content. There are three types of custom objects: FrameNode, RenderNode, and BuilderNode.  
  - **BuilderNode**: provides APIs for a BuilderNode â€“ a custom node that can be used to mount native components.
  - **FrameNode**: provides APIs for a FrameNode, which represents an entity node in the component tree. It can be used by a NodeController to mount a BuilderNode (that holds the FrameNode) to a NodeContainer or mount a RenderNode to another FrameNode.
  - **RenderNode**: provides APIs for creating a RenderNode in custom drawing settings at the native side.
  - **NodeController**: provides APIs for managing custom nodes, such as creating, showing, and updating custom nodes, and APIs for mounting custom nodes to a NodeContainer component.

- The NDK capabilities of components suitable for third-party frameworks are enhanced, covering component creation, attribute setting, event registration, customization, and component tree building.

- The capabilities of the **Navigation** component are enhanced, including the single- and dual-column switching animation, interruption and resumption of transition animations, and listening capabilities for the page lifecycle.

- The visual effect, animation, and interaction refresh of components are supported. Aging, mirror language, and screen reading are supported.

- You can define the color, shape, rounded corner, size, position, and shadow for menu and dialog box components.


### Bundle Manager

- Application clone access and management are supported. Applications can access application clones through simple configuration.

- Home screen shortcuts are supported. Users can dynamically add shortcuts to the home screen.

- The system-level HSP and ArkWeb can be upgraded independently, and preset applications can be updated independently.

- A recovery mechanism is provided upon OTA update interruption. If a power outage or service crash occurs during an OTA update, the OTA process is restored upon restart, continuing to install or update the applications.

- The **cache** directory can be automatically cleared when device space is insufficient.

- Applications can obtain the access permission of public directories (**Download**, **Desktop**, and **Document**) by applying for permissions (supported on some devices, subject to **syscap** judgment). Direct access is not allowed without permissions requested.

- Applications can select files or directories through File Picker and obtain temporary access permissions to the files or directories. Persistent access is also supported. Files or directories that are not persisted cannot be accessed after the applications exit.
