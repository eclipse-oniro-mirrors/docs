# 开源义务履行合规交付制品管理规范及指导

## 概述
社区开发者在引入和使用和再次分发第三方开源软件时，需要依据开源软件所包含的开源许可证中的条款要求，履行相应的开源义务，以满足开源合规要求。常见的开源义务分为：开源使用声明义务，代码对外开源义务，修改声明义务。 开源义务履行时所需的交付件，统称为开源合规交付制品。 本规范重点说明社区开源合规交付制品的规则和要求。 

## 开源软件使用声明义务履行合规制品管理规范
履行开源软件使用声明，业界常见方式为在版本发布时随版本发布NOTICE文档，在该文档中写明其中所使用的开源软件名、版权信息和许可证信息，并附上免责声明。

### 开源软件NOTICE使用场景

分发的二进制文件中包含有第三方开源软件，则需要提供以“NOTICE”命名的文件，进行开源软件使用声明。

### 开源软件NOTICE包含内容要求

开源软件NOTICE文件以纯文本格式描述包含的所有第三方开源软件名称、软件版本、权利人声明、License信息。

### 开源软件NOTICE生成规则及要求

[OpenHarmony开源软件Notice自动生成及收集策略说明](https://gitee.com/openharmony/build/blob/master/docs/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6Notice%E6%94%B6%E9%9B%86%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E.md)

### 开源软件NOTICE存放位置

#### OS设备镜像存放位置要求

1. 标准设备OS镜像tar包中system.img -> system/etc/NOTICE.txt。

2. 系统中存放在/system/etc/NOTICE.txt。

#### 应用软件存放位置要求
NOTICE文件通常放置在发布文件夹或压缩包的顶层目录，对于".jar"格式的文件，许可证可位于META-INF目录。

### 开源软件NOTICE的生命周期
NOTICE文件的生命周期，跟随发布二进制的生命周期，按照[OpenHarmony生命周期规则](https://gitee.com/openharmony/release-management/blob/master/OpenHarmony%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E5%85%AC%E5%91%8A.md)，支撑LTS、Release等版本。

### 开源软件NOTICE模板

完整的开源软件NOTICE 应包含以下内容。

```

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## 代码对外开源义务履行合规制品管理规范

1. 由于OpenHarmony版本是由OpenHarmony开源社区发布，代码本身已在OpenHarmony社区开源，因此无需额外提供开源软件包；[开源软件包生成](https://gitee.com/openharmony/build/blob/master/docs/%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E5%8C%85.md)
主要提供一种下游集成时需要自动生成的OpenHarmony所涉及的开源软件包的辅助工具和参考实现，OpenHarmony社区不对最终下游产品开源义务履行负责。
2. 针对开源许可证中条款，应满足对应许可证规则的义务要求，如：开源代码必须能够编译通过，且编译结果与分发软件制品中开源部分一致；在开源软件包中应附上编译指导，说明编译所需要的环境、工具及操作步骤，确保用户可以根据指导完成编译操作等。


## 修改声明履行合规制品管理规范

修改声明义务是按照部分开源许可证条款要求开发者对开源软件进行修改后，需对修改时间，修改的代码及修改过的文件做出声明的要求。

1. 若对开源软件的已有文件进行了修改，在被修改的文件头上附上修改声明，可参考以下模板。

```
*  20XX.XX.XX -  XXXXX（修改内容，简要说明修改）
                 Copyright(c)20XX. XXXXXXX （修改人版权声明，年份为代码修改年份）
```

2. 若对开源软件中新增了文件，需在文件头附上对应贡献者的版权和开源软件允许许可证及免责声明。
